          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since you are
          desirous, my friends, that I should relate to you, at length and in
          order, the things which happened to me during my journey to Rome,
          notwithstanding the pain which it must cost me to throw myself back
          into some of the feelings of that time, I cannot refuse to comply
          with your request. After threescore years spent in this remote
          province of an empire, happy, for the most part, in the protection
          of enlightened, just, and benevolent princes, I remember, far more
          accurately than things which occurred only a few months ago, the
          minutest particulars of what I saw and heard while I sojourned,
          young and a stranger, among the luxuries and cruelties of the
          capital of the world, as yet imperfectly recovered from the effects
          of the flagitious tyranny of the last of the
          Flavii.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg
          2]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My father, as
          you have heard, came with his legion into this island, and married
          a lady of native blood, some years before the first arrival of
          Agricola. In the wars of that illustrious commander, during the
          reigns of Vespasian and Titus, he had the fortune to find
          opportunities of distinguishing himself; but when his general was
          recalled, by the jealousy of Domitian, he retired from public life,
          and determined to spend the remainder of his days in peace, on the
          lands which belonged to him in right of his wife here in Britain.
          He laid the foundations of the house in which I have now the
          pleasure of receiving you; and here, in the cultivation of his
          fields, and in the superintendence of my education, he found
          sufficient employment for an active, though no longer an ambitious
          mind. Early in the reign of Trajan he died. Never did either Roman
          or British dwelling lament a more generous master.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot pretend
          to regret the accident which immediately afterwards separated me
          from a gentle mother—never to see her more upon the earth. Yet
          deeply was the happiness of my returning hour stained by that
          privation. It is the common rule of nature, that our parents should
          precede us to the grave; and it is also her rule, that our grief
          for them should not be of such power as to prevent us from
          entering, after they are gone, into a zealous participation both of
          the business and the pleasures of life. Yet, in after years, the
          memory of that buried tenderness rises up ever and anon, and wins
          rather than warns us to a deliberate contemplation of our own
          dissolution.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards the end
          of the winter following the death of my father, there arrived
          letters which engaged <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg
          3]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>anxious consideration. They were from members
          of his family, none of whom either my mother or myself had seen. It
          was explained, especially by Caius Licinius, the lawyer, (who was
          near of kin to our house,) that by the death of a certain
          Patrician, Cneius Valerius by name, I had become legally entitled
          to a very considerable fortune, to claim and take possession of
          which, demanded my immediate presence in the metropolis. My rights,
          said this jurist, were indeed called in question by another branch
          of the family, but were I on the spot, his professional exertions,
          with whatever interest he or any of his friends could command,
          should be at my service, for the sake of my father and of my
          name.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The love of
          travel had never before been excited in my bosom; but now that I
          knew I was so soon to embark for Italy, the delights which I might
          there hope to experience came crowding upon my imagination. The
          dark and pine-clad banks of my native Anton, said I, shall now be
          exchanged for that golden-waved Tiber, of which so many illustrious
          poets have sung. Instead of moving here among the ill-cemented and
          motley fabric of an insulated colony, and seeing only the sullen
          submission of barbarians on the one hand, or the paltry vanity of
          provincial deputies on the other, I shall tread the same ground
          with the rulers of the earth, and wear, among native Romans, the
          gown of my ancestors. I shall behold the Forum, which has heard the
          eloquence of Cicero and Hortensius; I shall ascend to the Capitol,
          where Cæsar triumphed; I shall wander in the luxurious gardens of
          Sallust, or breathe the fresh air in the fields of Cato: I shall
          gaze upon the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg
          4]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>antique majesty of temples and palaces, and
          open my eyes on all that art and nature have been able to heap
          together through eight centuries, for the ornament of the chosen
          seat of wisdom and valour.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A single trusty
          slave was selected to accompany me. It was not certainly on account
          of his accomplishments that Boto had been chosen for this duty; for
          although he had lived all his days in the vicinity of the colonists
          at Venta, there was scarcely a person within the bounds of the
          British Belgæ that spoke worse Latin. He was, however, a man of
          natural sagacity, possessing shrewd discernment concerning whatever
          things had fallen under his customary observation; and he shewed no
          symptom either of diffidence respecting his qualifications for this
          new office, or of regret at being separated from those in whose
          company many years of gentle servitude had glided over his
          sun-burnt countenance. It was reported to me, that he invited
          several of our rustics to drink with him in one of the out-houses,
          where his exultation knew no limits. He was going to Rome, for his
          young master very well knew he could never get on in such a journey
          without the helping eye and hand of Boto; and he had a brother in
          Italy already, (he had gone over with a distinguished legionary
          some ten years before,) and from him (for he would of course meet
          with him as soon as our arrival should be known) he would receive
          all requisite information concerning the doings of the great city.
          The usefulness which, he doubted not, I should be constrained to
          acknowledge in his manifold qualifications, would, without all
          question, entitle him to some signal reward—perhaps nothing less
          than manumission on his return.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days passed
          more quickly than any I ever remember to have spent amidst a
          strange mixture of mirth, and sorrow, and noisy preparation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Where that
          single tall naked pine now stands buffeted by the wind, then grew a
          thick grove, of which that relic alone survives. It was there that
          I turned round to gaze once more on the quiet verdure of these
          paternal fields, and our small pastoral stream glistening here and
          there beneath the shady covert of its margin.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had at first
          intended to cross over to Gaul, and traversing that province, enter
          Italy, either by the route of the Alps, in case we could procure
          convenient guides and companions, or by some vessel sailing from
          Marseilles or Forum Julii to Ostium. But the advice of one of my
          neighbours, who had himself been a great traveller, made me alter
          this plan, and resolve to commit myself to the care of an
          experienced mariner who was just about to sail for Italy, by the
          way of the pillars of Hercules, in a vessel laden chiefly with tin;
          and on reaching the Clausentum, I found this man, with several
          passengers, ready for the voyage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the first
          three or four days, I was so afflicted by the motion of the vessel,
          that I could bestow little attention on any external object; my
          eyes were so confused and dazzled, that I saw nothing beyond the
          corner of the deck on which I had caused my carpets to be laid; and
          a few ejaculations to Castor and Pollux were all the articulate
          sounds that I uttered. By degrees, however, the weight of my
          depression began to be alleviated; and at intervals, more
          particularly during the night watches, if I was not altogether in
          possession of myself, I was at least well enough to enjoy a sort of
          giddy delight in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg
          6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>watching the billows as they rose and
          retreated from the prow. There were moments, also, in which the
          behaviour of Boto, under this new species of calamity, could
          furnish me, as it had already done the more hardy of my
          fellow-voyagers, with store of mirth. Near us frequently, upon the
          deck, sat a Captain of the Prætorian Bands, who, more than any
          other of these, displayed a florid complexion and cheerful eye,
          unalterable by the fluctuation of the waters. This Sabinus had
          served in all the wars of Agricola, and accompanied him even in his
          perilous circumnavigation of the islands which lie scattered to the
          north of Britain. He had also gone back to Rome with his commander,
          not, like him, to extenuate imperial jealousy by the affectation of
          indolence, but to seek for new occupation on some other disturbed
          frontier of the Empire. In Syria and Cappadocia he had spent some
          years; after which, he had attended the Emperor himself through
          Mæsia and Illyricum, and all those countries he traversed and
          retraversed, during that shameful contest in which so many Roman
          eagles were made the prey of barbarous enemies, and which
          terminated at last in that cowardly treaty, by which Domitian
          granted a diadem to Decebalus, and condescended to place the Roman
          Senate among the tributaries of a Dacian. Our friend had also
          strutted his part in that gorgeous triumph, or rather succession of
          triumphs, by which the defeated and disgraced Prince, on his return
          from the Ister, mocked the eyes and ears of the incredulous and
          indignant Romans. In a word, he had partaken in all kinds of
          fortune, good and evil, and preserved his rubicundity and
          equanimity unaltered in them all. Having attained <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page7">[pg 7]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to a situation of some dignity, he had
          now been visiting Britain on a special message from the new
          Emperor, and was returning in the hope that no future accident of
          fortune, or princely caprice, would ever again make it necessary
          for him to quit the shows and festivities of the capital.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
          good-natured man sat down beside my suffering peasant, endeavouring
          to withdraw his attention from the pangs of his sickness, by
          pointing out the different boats which came in view as we held on
          from the Gobæan rocks, keeping close to the shore as we went, in
          order to shun, as well as we could, the customary fury of the
          Aquitanic Ocean. <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold these
          fishing-vessels,”</span> he would cry, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“which have undoubtedly been upon the coast of Rutupia
          for oysters, or it may be about the mouth of yonder Ligoris for
          turbot, and are now stretching all their canvass to get home with
          their booty to Italy. Smooth be your winds and fair your passage,
          oh rare fish!”</span> To which the downcast Boto would reply,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Lavish not, oh master, your good wishes
          upon the mute fish, which have been tossed about all their lives,
          but reserve them rather for me (unhappy) who am thus tormented in
          an unnatural and intolerable manner;”</span> or perhaps,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Speak not, I beseech you, of oysters, or
          of turbot, or of any other eatable, for I believe I shall never
          again feel hungry, so grievously are all my internal parts
          discomposed. Oh, that I had never left my native fields, and
          bartered the repose of my whole body for the vain hope of
          gratification to my eyes!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By degrees,
          however, custom reconciled all of us to the motion of the bark, and
          the weather being calm during the greater part of the voyage, I
          enjoyed, at my <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page8">[pg
          8]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>leisure, the beauties, both of the sea, and of
          the shores alongst which we glided. From time to time, we put in
          for water and other necessaries, to various sea-ports of the
          Spanish Peninsula; but our stay was never so long at any place as
          to admit of us losing sight of our vessel. Our chief delight,
          indeed, consisted in the softness and amenity of the moonlight
          nights we spent in sailing along the coasts of Mauritania,—now the
          dark mountains of the family of Atlas throwing their shadows far
          into the sea—and anon, its margin glittering with the white towers
          of Siga, or Gilba, or Cartenna, or some other of the rich cities of
          that old Carthaginian region. On such nights it was the custom of
          all the passengers to be congregated together upon the deck, where
          the silent pleasures of contemplation were, from time to time,
          interrupted by some merry song chanted in chorus by the mariners,
          or perhaps some wild barbarian ditty, consecrated by the zeal of
          Boto to the honour of some ancient indigenous hero of the North.
          Nor did our jovial Prætorian disdain to contribute now and then to
          the amusement of the assembly, by some boisterous war-song,
          composed, perhaps, by some light-hearted young spearman, which our
          centurion might have learned by heart, without any regular
          exertion, from hearing it sung around many a British and Dacian
          watch-fire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we
          contrived to pass the time in a cheerful manner, till we reached
          the Lilybæan promontory. We tarried there two days to refit some
          part of our rigging, and then stretched boldly across the lower
          sea, towards the mouth of the Tiber. We were becalmed, however, for
          a whole day and night, after we had come within <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page9">[pg 9]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sight of the Pharos of Ostium, where,
          but for the small boats that came out to us with fresh fish and
          fruit, we should have had some difficulty in preserving our
          patience; for, by this time, our stock of wine was run to the last
          cup, and nothing remained to be eat but some mouldy biscuit which
          had survived two voyages between Italy and Britain. During this
          unwelcome delay, the Prætorian endeavoured to give me as much
          information as he could about the steps necessary to be pursued on
          my arrival in the city. But, to say truth, his experience had lain
          chiefly among martial expeditions and jovial recreations, so that I
          could easily perceive he was no great master of the rules of civil
          life. From him, however, I was glad to find, that the reputation of
          Licinius was really as great at Rome as it had been represented in
          our province; and, indeed, he treated me with a yet greater measure
          of attention after he was informed of my relationship to that
          celebrated jurist.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in the
          morning, a light breeze sprung up from the west, and with joyful
          acclamations the sails were once again uplifted. The number of
          mariners on board was insufficient for impelling the heavily laden
          vessel altogether by the force of oars, but now they did not refuse
          to assist the favouring breeze with strenuous and lively exertion.
          The Prætorian cheered and incited them by his merry voice, and even
          the passengers were not loath to assist them in this labour. My
          slave, among the rest, joined in the toil; but his awkwardness soon
          relieved him from his seat on the bench; a disgrace which he would
          have shared with his master, had I been equally officious.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ere long, we
          could trace with exactness those enor<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>mous structures by which the munificence of
          Augustus had guarded and adorned that great avenue of nations to
          the imperial city. Those mountains of marble, projected on either
          side into the deep, surpassed every notion I had formed of the
          extent to which art may carry its rivalry of nature. Their
          immovable masses were garnished here and there with towers and
          battlements, on which the Prætorian pointed out to me the
          frame-work of those terrible catapults, and other engines of
          warfare, of which no specimens have ever been seen in Britain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner had we
          stept upon the shore, than we were surrounded by a great throng of
          hard-favoured persons, who pulled us by the cloak, with innumerable
          interrogations and offers of service. Among these, the varieties of
          form, complexion, and accent, were such, that we could not regard
          them without especial wonder; for it appeared as if every tribe and
          language under heaven had sent some representative to this great
          seaport of Rome. The fair hair and blue eye of the Gaul or German,
          might here be seen close by the tawny skin of the Numidian or
          Getulian slave, or the shining blackness of the Ethiopian visage.
          The Greek merchant was ready, with his Thracian bondsman carrying
          his glittering wares upon his back; the usurer was there, with his
          arms folded closely in his mantle; nor was the Chaldean or Assyrian
          soothsayer awanting, with his air of abstraction and his flowing
          beard.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Boto, as if
          alarmed with the prevailing bustle, and fearful lest some untoward
          accident should separate us, kept close behind me, grasping my
          gown. But our good friend Sabinus did not long leave us in this
          perplexity; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg
          11]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>for, having hastily engaged the master of a
          small barge to carry him to Rome, he insisted that I should partake
          of this easy method of conveyance. We found the vessel small but
          convenient, furnished with a red awning, under which cushions and
          carpets were already stretched out for our repose. The oars were
          soon in motion, and we began to emerge from among the forest of
          masts with a rapidity which astonished me; for the multitude of
          vessels of all sizes, continually crossing and re-crossing, was so
          great, that at first I expected every moment some dangerous
          accident might occur.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By degrees,
          however, such objects failed to keep alive my attention; the
          sleeplessness of the preceding night, and the abundance of an
          Ostian repast, conspiring to lull me into a gentle doze, which
          continued for I know not what space. I awoke, greatly refreshed,
          and found we had made considerable progress; for the continual
          succession of stately edifices already indicated the vicinity of
          the metropolis. The dark green of the venerable groves, amidst
          which the buildings were, for the most part, embosomed, and the
          livelier beauties of the parterres which here and there intervened
          between these and the river, afforded a soft delight to my eyes,
          which had so long been fatigued with the uniform flash and dazzle
          of the Mediterranean waves, and the roughness of the sea-beaten
          precipices. The minute and elaborate cultivation every where
          visible, the smoothness of the shorn turf on the margin, the
          graceful foliage of the ancient planes and sycamores,—but, above
          all, the sublimity of the porticos and arcades, and the air of
          established and inviolable elegance which pervaded the whole
          region, kept my mind in pleasurable wonder. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Here and there, a gentle winding
          conducted us through some deep and massy shade of oaks and elms;
          whose branches, stretching far out from either side, diffused a
          sombre and melancholy blackness almost entirely over the face of
          Tiber. Loitering carelessly, or couched supinely, beneath some of
          these hoary branches, we could see, from time to time, the figure
          of some stately Roman, or white-robed lady, with her favourite
          scroll of parchment in her hand. The cool and glassy rippling of
          the water produced a humming music of stillness in the air, which
          nothing disturbed, save only the regular dash of the oars, and, now
          and then, the deep and strenuous voice of our cautious helmsman.
          Anon would ensue some glimpse of the open champaign, descending
          with all its wealth of golden sheaves to the very brink of the
          river—or, perhaps, the lively courts of a farmyard stretching along
          the margin of some tributary streamlet—or some long expanse of
          level meadow, with herds of snow-white heifers. I could not gaze
          upon the rich and splendid scene without reverting, with a strange
          mixture of emotions, to the image of this my native land; its wild
          forests, shaggy with brushwood and unprofitable coppice, through
          which of old the enormous wild deer stalked undisturbed, except by
          the adder of the grass, or the obscene fly of the thicket; its
          little patches of corn and meadow, laboriously rescued from the
          domain of the wild beast, and rudely fortified against his
          continual incursions;—the scattered hamlets of this Brigian valley,
          and my own humble villa—then humbler than it is now. Trees, and
          temples, and gardens, and meadows, and towns, and villages, were,
          ere long, lost in one uniform sobriety of twilight; and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span><a name="Pg013"
          id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it was already quite dark,
          when the centurion, pointing to the left bank, said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold the Gardens of Cæsar: beyond, is the Portian
          Gate, and the street of the Rural Lares. In a few moments we shall
          see the lights of the Sublician Bridge, and be in the city.”</span>
          At these words I started up, and gazing forward, could penetrate
          through the mists of evening into the busy glare of a thousand
          streets and lanes, opening upon the river. The old wall was already
          visible; where, after having swept round the region towards the
          Vatican and Janicular Hills, it brings the last of its turrets
          close down to the Tiber, over against the great dock-yards by the
          Field of Brutus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Through a forest
          of triremes, galleys, and all sorts of craft, we then shot on to
          the bridge—beneath the centre arch of which our steersman conducted
          us. Beyond, such was the hum of people on the quays, and such the
          star-like profusion of lights reflected in the water, that we
          doubted not we had already reached the chief seat of the bustle of
          Rome. On, however, we still held our course, till the theatre of
          Marcellus rose like a mountain on our right. It was there that we
          ran our bark into the shore, not far from the little bridge—the
          third as you ascend the river—which conducts to the Island and the
          Temple of Æsculapius. While our friend was settling matters with
          the master, and the attendants were bringing out our baggage, I
          stood by myself on the elevated quay. Here a long tier of reflected
          radiance bespoke, it may be, the vicinity of some splendid
          portico—of palace, or temple, or bath, or theatre; there a broad
          and steady blaze of burning red, indicated the abode of artizans,
          resolved, as it seemed, on carrying <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>their toil into the bosom of the night.
          Between—some speck of lustre betrayed, perhaps, the lamp of the
          solitary student, or the sober social hour of some peaceful family,
          assembled around the hearth of their modest lares. Behold me then,
          said I, in the capital of the globe; but were I to be swallowed up
          this moment in the waves of Tiber, not one of all these lights
          would be dimmed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Being told that
          my relation had his residence at no great distance, the friendly
          Sabinus insisted upon escorting me thither in safety. We walked,
          therefore, along two or three proud streets, which brought us near
          to the Pantheon of Agrippa, and there the house was easily pointed
          out to us; its porch decorated with recent palm-branches, which the
          Centurion said must have been placed there by the joyful hands of
          some fortunate client. Here having thanked this kind person, and
          left honest Boto among the crowd of slaves in the vestibule, I was
          speedily conducted into the presence of the Patrician.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I found him in a
          small upper chamber, lighted by a single silver lamp suspended from
          the roof, enjoying, as it appeared, repose and relaxation after the
          exertions of the day. He was reclining when I entered; and although
          supper was long over, some fruits and other trifling things still
          remained on the board. At table with him there was no one present,
          excepting a Greek of solemn aspect, whom he introduced to me as the
          superintendent of his son’s education, and Sextus himself, a modest
          and ingenuous youth, who sat at the lower extremity of his father’s
          couch. He was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg
          16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>indeed a very mild and amiable young man, and
          I had more pleasure, after a space, in surveying his features, than
          the more marked lineaments of the other two. At first, however,
          nothing riveted my attention so much as the energetic physiognomy
          of the Senator. The forepart of his head was already quite bald,
          although the darkness of the short curls behind testified that age
          was not the cause of this deformity. His eyes were black and rapid,
          and his eyebrows vibrated in a remarkable manner, not only when he
          spoke, but even when he was silent; indicating, as it appeared, by
          their transitions, every new train of thought and imagination
          within his mind. His style of conversation was quick and fervid,
          and his gestures vehement as he spake; it being apparent, that,
          from restlessness and vanity of disposition, he was continually
          exercising a needless measure of mental activity and anxiety. Not
          satisfied with his own sufficient richness of ideas, no thought
          could be expressed which he did not immediately seize upon, and
          explain, even to him by whom it had been first suggested, with much
          fluency and earnestness of illustration. On the other hand, the
          guest, who wore a long beard reaching to his girdle, preserved in
          all things an uncommon demureness of manner, restraining every
          salient movement of his mind, and watching, with the gravity of a
          Numa, the glancing eyes and sharp features of his patron. A roll of
          yellow parchment graced his left hand, but the other was employed
          in selecting from the table such articles as were most agreeable to
          his palate. Licinius, although meagre in person, and at that time
          parched with declamation, seemed to live in such a state of
          intellectual excitement, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg
          17]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>that he thought little either of eating or
          drinking; therefore, the Athenian, resigning, for the most part,
          his share of the conversation, amused himself, in exchange, with
          the more trivial gratifications abandoned to him by his host. Nor,
          if one might draw any conclusion from his complexion and figure,
          was this the first occasion on which Xerophrastes had exercised
          that species of humility.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Licinius
          had inquired of me concerning my native place, and also given a few
          words to the affairs which had brought me to the city, his
          conversation was naturally directed to subjects more new to me, if
          not more interesting to him. <span class="tei tei-q">“You would
          observe,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“the palm
          branches at my door. They were won to-day by a five hours’ harangue
          before the Centumviri. It is only in contests such as these that
          men of my order have now any opportunity to exercise themselves,
          and preserve some remembrance of those ancient worthies and great
          public characters that once adorned the state. To these things,
          therefore, young kinsman, I entirely devote myself; nor aim, like
          other citizens of rank, at passing the day in diversion, and ending
          it with luxuries. At supper my table is furnished with moderate
          fare, while in other houses I know not how many roasted boars and
          pompous sturgeons have been regaling with the rich perfume of their
          sauces and stuffing, guests who love the meat more than the man who
          gives it. This learned person knows how laborious is my course of
          life, and what an impatient crowd awaits my appearance every
          morning. His pupil will, I hope, tread in the same steps, and
          afford to a future generation the image of the former
          Licinius.”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg
          18]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>With these, and the like discourses, he
          occupied our ears till it was time to retire; and then intimated
          that he had allotted to me an apartment which he expected I would
          continually occupy during my residence in the city. But being
          informed that I had a British slave with me, he insisted on having
          this man sent for, that he might see him, as he expressed it,
          before the genuine unsophisticated barbarian had been corrupted by
          keeping company with the cunning menials of the metropolis.
          Whereupon, it was commanded that Boto should come up, and he was
          forthwith ushered in by a certain leering varlet, with rings in his
          ears, whose face resembled some comic mask in the habitual archness
          of its malicious and inquisitive look.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not few were the
          bows and scrapes with which my Briton entered these penetralia; nor
          was the astonishment inconsiderable with which the orator regarded
          Boto. <span class="tei tei-q">“So, friend,”</span> said
          Licinius,—<span class="tei tei-q">“and you have ventured to come to
          Rome, without so much as shaving your beard?”</span> But the merry
          and good-natured tone in which these words were uttered, having
          somewhat reassured the bashful rustic, he gave a sly side-look
          towards the philosopher, (who, I think, had never once glanced at
          him,) and replied to Licinius, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pardon me,
          O master, for coming thus into your presence; but I knew not, till
          Dromo told me, that beards were worn in Rome only by goats and the
          wisest of mankind.”</span> The words of the barbarian amused the
          orator—but, turning round to his own slave, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah! Dromo,”</span> said he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“do I already recognize the effects of your
          teaching?—beware the whip, corrupt not this good Briton, at your
          peril.”</span> He then asked of Boto <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>various questions concerning his recent
          voyage; to all of which he made answers after his own fashion,
          sufficiently sagacious. Great contempt, however, was depicted on
          the face of the silent stoic during this conversation; which he, no
          doubt, looked upon as a very unworthy condescension on the part of
          Licinius; till at last, having, in a leisurely manner, poured out
          the last of the flagon, Xerophrastes arose from his couch and
          departed. As he withdrew, he unfortunately struck his knee on the
          corner of the table, which elicited from his stubborn features a
          sudden contortion. This, however, he immediately smoothed of,
          twisting his involuntary stoop into an obeisance to the
          Senator.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Young Sextus
          conducted me to my chamber; and we conversed together with easy
          juvenile confidence for some time before he left me.</p>

          III.</span></span></h1>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My sleep was
          sound and sweet; nevertheless, when the morning began to dawn, I
          was awakened by its first glimmerings, and found that my thoughts
          became at once too busy to admit of a return to slumber. I
          therefore arose, and went to walk in an open gallery, with which my
          chamber was connected. This gallery commanded a prospect of a great
          part of the city, which at that hour appeared no less tranquil than
          stately, nothing being in motion except a few small boats gliding
          here and there upon the river. Neither as yet had any smoke begun
          to darken the atmosphere; so that all things were seen in a serene
          and steady light, the shadows falling broadly westward over streets
          and squares—but pillars, and obelisks, and arches, rising up every
          where with unsullied magnificence into the bright air of the
          morning. The numerous poplars and other lofty trees of the gardens,
          also, seemed to be rejoicing in the hour of dew and silence; so
          fresh and cheerful was the intermixture of their branches among the
          piles of white and yellow marble. Near at hand, over the groves of
          the Philoclean Mansion, I could see the dome of the Pantheon, all
          burnished with living gold, and the proud colonnades of the
          Flaminian Circus, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg
          21]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>loaded with armies of brazen statues. Between
          these and the river, the theatres of Pompey and Marcellus, and I
          know not how many temples, were visible. Across a more crowded
          region, to the westward, my eye ascended to the cliffs and towers
          of the Capitol; while, still farther removed from me, (although
          less elevated in natural situation,) the gorgeous mansion of the
          Emperor was seen, lifted up, like some new and separate city, upon
          its enormous fabric of arcades. Behind me, the Flavian
          Amphitheatre, the newest and the most majestic of all Roman
          edifices, detained the eye for a space from all that lay beyond
          it—the splendid mass of the Esquiline—and those innumerable
          aqueducts which lie stretched out, arch after arch, and pillar
          after pillar, across the surrounding plain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As I stood upon
          a projecting balcony, I heard some person stepping softly along the
          floor, and, being screened by some pillars, looked back into the
          gallery without subjecting myself to observation in return. The
          noise, I found, was occasioned by one of the slaves of Licinius,
          (the same I had remarked over night,) who had an air of anxious
          vigilance on this occasion, looking about from side to side as if
          afraid of being detected in some impropriety. I heard him tap at
          one of the apartments adjoining my own, and young Sextus, opening
          the door, eagerly asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, Dromo, good
          Dromo, what news?—Have you seen or heard any thing of her?—Speak
          low, I beseech you, and remember that my preceptor is near.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Which preceptor?”</span> replied Dromo;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“count me your best, and I will teach you
          how to manage all besides.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hush!”</span> whispered the young man; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he may be astir with these eternal
          parchments.”</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg
          22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Be easy,”</span>
          returned the slave; <span class="tei tei-q">“I have found out facts
          which will serve to bridle that tongue at any
          time.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Dromo,”</span> said Sextus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“have a care; remember the thong of sleek
          leather which hangs at the foot of the stair-case; and many is the
          time I have saved you from it; for which you may, perhaps, have to
          thank the beauty of her who has rendered you necessary to me, as
          much as my own good nature. But no more idle words at present—what
          have you to tell me?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have just been down,”</span> answered he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“to the herb-market. I had made my bargain,
          and was coming away, when I met one of old Capito’s men, driving an
          ass laden with articles from the country. So I asked if he was
          carrying a present to his master’s brother. He said he had brought
          nothing for Lucius but a letter; and that he believed its purport
          was to invite the two young ladies, to come out to-day and enjoy
          the beauty of the season. I no sooner got this information, than I
          ran hither as swiftly as my legs would carry me. You can easily go
          out, as if by chance, to pay your respects to the
          Patrician.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah, Sempronia!”</span> sighed Sextus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“shall I approach you at last?—What will she think when
          she sees me there?—Oh, how will she speak to me?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While he was
          uttering these words, Dromo suddenly started, and came peeping on
          tiptoe towards the place where I stood. I stepped from behind my
          pillar, and said to the astonished youth, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Fear not, Sextus, that I shall intermeddle with your
          secrets, or make any use of what I have accidentally overheard. But
          I wish you would satisfy my curiosity, and inform me who is this
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg023"
          id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lady, and what may be the
          meaning of all this concealment?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here Dromo,
          perceiving that his young master was a good deal confused, came
          forward and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“From observing your
          looks last night, when I was making a handle of yon barbarian to
          torture our friend of the porch, I think you are a good-natured
          person, who would not willingly bring any of us into trouble. The
          truth is, that Licinius wishes my young master here to marry a
          certain lady, who has already had wet eyes over the ashes of a
          first husband; but who is of noble birth, and very rich. Now
          Sextus, being only eighteen, does not like this great lady so well
          as she likes him; and has, in fact, lost his heart
          elsewhere.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Dromo,”</span> answered
          I, taking young Sextus by the hand as I spoke, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“this is a pretty common sort of story; but I shall
          take no side till I have seen both of the ladies; and the sooner
          your ingenuity can bring that about, the more shall I be beholden
          to you.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“We shall try,”</span>
          replied the slave, observing that I had overcome the reluctance of
          the lover; <span class="tei tei-q">“but in the meantime I observe
          that the clients are beginning to assemble in the porch, to await
          the forthcoming of Licinius. Go, therefore, and get some breakfast,
          for, by and by, you will both be expected to accompany the Senator
          to the Forum, to hear him plead; which, between ourselves, will be
          a six hours’ job for you, unless you manage matters
          dexterously.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This hint
          produced a visible effect on Sextus; but we went down together
          immediately to an apartment, where some bread and grapes were
          prepared for us; and there, with much ingenuousness, he opened his
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg024"
          id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>heart to me. But what
          surprised me most of all, was to hear, that although he had been
          enamoured of Sempronia for several months, and was well acquainted
          with several of her relations, he had never yet seen her, except at
          certain places of public resort, nor enjoyed any opportunity of
          making known his passion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While I was
          expressing my astonishment at this circumstance, we were
          interrupted by Xerophrastes, who came to inform us that Licinius,
          having already descended into the hall, was about to issue forth,
          and desirous of my company, if no other occupation detained me. We
          accordingly followed the philosopher, and found his patron where he
          had indicated, pacing to and fro, in the highest state of
          excitation, like a generous steed about to scour the field of
          battle. The waxen effigies of his ancestors stood at one end of the
          hall, some of them defaced with age; and upon these he frequently
          fixed his ardent eyes. Seeing me enter, he immediately cried out,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Come hither, young friend, and I shall
          presently conduct you to a scene worthy, above all others, of the
          curiosity of a stranger.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this,
          arranging his gown, and putting himself into a dignified attitude,
          he ordered the porter, who stood chained by the door, to throw wide
          its massy valves; which being done, the litigants and consulters,
          who were without, received the orator with acclamations, and
          surrounded him on all sides. Some of the poorer ones, I observed
          kissing the hem of his garment, and dodging wistfully at his
          elbows, without ever attracting a word or look from him; while
          those of a higher class came forward more familiarly, seeking to
          impress particular circumstances upon his memory, and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>paying him compliments on the appearance
          he had made the day before in the Centumviral Court. Encircled by
          this motley group, he walked towards the great Forum, followed at a
          little distance by Sextus, the preceptor, myself, and some freedmen
          of his household. In moving on, we passed, by accident, the door of
          another great pleader, by name Bruttianus, who stood there attended
          in a similar manner. When he perceived Licinius, this man took from
          his door-post a green palm-branch, and waved it towards us in a
          vaunting manner; but our friend, saluting him courteously, cried
          out, with his sharp and cutting voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“We
          shall try it again.”</span> Whereon Xerophrastes, immediately
          stepping up to his patron, began thus, <span class="tei tei-q">“How
          this vain-glorious person exposes himself!—he is certainly a weak
          man; and his tones, by Hermes, are more detestable than those of an
          African fowl.”</span>—At which words, Sextus tipped me the wink;
          but I did not observe that Licinius was at all displeased with
          them. Yet, soon after, Bruttianus having overtaken us, the
          processions were joined, and the two pleaders walked the rest of
          the way together in a loving manner, exchanging complimentary
          speeches; to which Xerophrastes listened with edifying gravity of
          visage.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length we
          entered that venerable space, every yard of whose surface is
          consecrated to the peculiar memory of some great incident in the
          history of Rome. Young Sextus allowed me to contemplate for some
          time, with silent wonder, the memorable objects which conspired to
          the decoration of this remarkable place; but after the first gaze
          of astonishment was satisfied, proceeded to point out, in order,
          the names and uses of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg
          26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
          principal structures which rose on every side over its
          porticos—above all, of its sublime temples—into whose cool and
          shady recesses the eye could here and there penetrate through the
          open valves. Nor did the ancient rostrum from which Tully had
          declaimed, escape our observation—nor within its guarding rail of
          silver, the rising shoots of the old mysterious fig-tree of
          Romulus—nor the rich tesselated pavement which covered the spot
          that had once yawned an abyss before the steady eye of Curtius—nor
          the resplendent Milliary pillar which marked the centre of the
          place. In a word, had the gathering crowds permitted, I could have
          willingly spent many hours in listening to the explanation of such
          magnificent objects; but these, and the elevated voice of Licinius,
          who was just beginning his harangue, soon compelled me to attend to
          things of another description.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within one of
          the proud ranges of arcade, on the side nearest to the Capitoline
          stairs, a majestic Patrician had already taken his seat on an
          elevated tribunal—his assessors being arranged on a lower bench by
          his side, and the orators and clients congregated beneath. When I
          heard the clear and harmonious periods of my kinsman; when I
          observed with what apparent simplicity he laid his foundations in a
          few plain facts and propositions; with what admirable art he
          upreared from these a superstructure of conclusions, equally easy
          as unexpected; when he had conducted us to the end of his argument,
          and closed with a burst of passionate eloquence, in which he seemed
          to leave even himself behind him, I could not but feel as if I had
          now for the first time contemplated the practised strength of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027"
          id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>intellect. Yet I have lived
          to discover that the talent which so greatly excited my wonder is
          often possessed from nature, or acquired through practice, in a
          measure which at that time would have afforded me scarcely inferior
          delight, by men of no extraordinary rank.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The keen and
          lively gestures of the fervid Licinius, whose soul seemed to speak
          out of every finger he moved, and who appeared to be altogether
          immersed in the cause he pleaded, were succeeded by the solemn and
          somewhat pompous stateliness of Bruttianus, who made a brief pause
          between every two sentences, as if he were apprehensive that the
          mind of the judge could not keep pace with the stream of his
          illustrations, and looked round ever and anon upon the spectators
          with a placid and assured smile, rather, as it seemed to me, to
          signify his approbation of their taste in applauding him, than his
          own pleasure in their applauses. Nevertheless, he also was a
          splendid speaker, and his affectation displeased the more, because
          it was evidently unworthy of his understanding. While he was
          speaking, I observed that the Stoic preceptor was frequently
          shifting his place among the crowd, and muttering every where
          expressions of high contempt. But this did not disgust me so much
          as the fixed attitude of ecstasy in which he listened to the
          discourse of his own patron, and the pretended involuntary
          exclamations of his delight. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, admirable
          cadence!”</span> he would say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I feel as
          if I were draining a honey-comb. Oh, harmonious man, where have I,
          or any other person here, sucked in such sweetness!”</span> These
          absurd phrases, however, were caught up forthwith, and repeated by
          the numerous young men who hung upon the skirts of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the orator, and seemed, indeed, to be
          drinking in nectar from the speech, if one might judge from their
          countenances. From their taking notes in their tablets from time to
          time, and from the knowing looks they assumed at the commencement
          of every new chain of argument, I guessed that these might be
          embryo jurisconsults, preparing themselves by their attendance for
          future exertions of the same species; and, indeed, when I listened
          to their conversation at the close of every speech, I thought I
          could perceive in their tones and accents, studied mimicry of the
          natural peculiarities of Licinius, Bruttianus, and the other
          orators. Altogether, the scene was as full of amusement as of
          novelty, and I could willingly have remained to the end of the
          discussion. But my eyes chanced to fall upon young Sextus, and I
          could not but see that his mind was occupied in matters remote from
          the business of the Forum. He stood with his arms folded in his
          gown, and his eyes fixed upon the ground, only lifting them up from
          time to time with an impatient air towards a side entrance, or to
          observe by the shadows on the porticos what progress the sun was
          making.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perceiving, at
          length, that Xerophrastes had his back turned to us, and that his
          father was engaged with his tablets, he plucked me by the sleeve. I
          understood his meaning, and followed him quickly through the crowd;
          nor did we look back till we had left the noise of the Forensic
          assembly entirely behind us. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
          depriving you,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“of no
          great gratification, for that old creature is, indeed, possessed of
          much natural shrewdness, but he is bitter from observing that his
          reputation is rather eclipsed by younger people, and looks like
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029"
          id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>some worn-out and discarded
          cat, grinning from the top of the wall at the dalliance of some
          sleeker rival. You could find no delight in the angry sneerings of
          such an envious person; and his age would prevent you, at the same
          time, from willingly giving way to contemptuous emotions. I will be
          your guide to the villa. But if any questions be asked on our
          return, you can say I was anxious to shew you something of the
          other regions of the city.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hurried me
          through noble streets, and past innumerable edifices, before each
          of which I would gladly have paused. Nevertheless, seeing him
          wrapped up in anxious thoughts, I did not oppose myself to his
          inclinations; and ere long, having passed the Hill of Gardens, I
          found that we had gained the eastern limit of the city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A sharp walk of
          about an hour and a half on the Salarean Way, brought us within
          sight of the Suburban of Capito.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A lofty wall
          protected the fields of this retirement from the intrusive eyes of
          passengers. We entered by a small side-door, and found ourselves,
          as if by some magical delusion, transported from the glare of a
          Roman highway, into the depth and silence of some primeval forest.
          No nicely trimmed path conducted our feet. Every thing had at least
          the appearance of being left as nature had formed it. The fern
          rustled beneath us as we moved; the ivy was seen spreading its
          careless tresses from tree to tree; the fawn bounded from the
          thicket. By degrees, however, the gloom lessened, till at length,
          over an open space of lawn, we perceived the porch of entrance, and
          a long line of colonnade. We passed under the porch, and across a
          paved court where a fountain was playing, into the great hall,
          which commanded all the other side of the place—a noble prospect of
          elaborate gardens gradually rising into shady hills, and lost in a
          distance of impenetrable wood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here a freedman
          attended us, who informed us that Capito had retired into a
          sequestered part of the grounds <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>with some friends from the city; but that if
          we chose we could easily join him there. We assented, and,
          following his guidance, ere long traversed no narrow space of
          luxuriant cultivation. From one perfumed terrace we descended to
          another; till, having reached a certain green and mossy walk,
          darkened by a natural arching of vines and mulberries, the freedman
          pointed to a statue at the farther end, and told us it stood over
          against the entrance of his master’s summer-house. When we reached
          the statue, however, we could perceive no building. The shaded
          avenue terminated in face of a precipitous rock, from which there
          fell a small stream that was received in a massive basin, where the
          waters foamed into spray without transgressing the margin. A
          thousand delicious plants and far-sought flowers clustered around
          the base of the rock and the brink of the fountain, and the humming
          of innumerable bees mingled with the whispers of the stream. We
          stood for a moment uncertain whether we should move on or retire,
          when we heard one calling to us from beyond; and passing to the
          other side of the basin, descried, between the rock and the falling
          water, a low entrance into what seemed to be a natural cave or
          grotto. We stooped, and found ourselves within one of the most
          luxurious retirements ever haunted by the foot of Dryad. A sparry
          roof hung like a canopy of gems and crystals over a group of
          sculptured Nymphs and Fawns, which were placed on a rustic pedestal
          within a circular bath shaped out of the living stone. Around the
          edge of the waveless waters that slumbered in this green recess,
          were spread carpets rich with the dyes of Tyrian art, whereon
          Capito was reposing with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg
          32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his
          friends. He received Sextus with kindness, and me with politeness,
          introducing us both to his companions, who were three in number—all
          of them, like himself, advanced in years, and two of them wearing
          long beards, though their demeanour was destitute of any thing like
          the affected stateliness of our friend Xerophrastes. These two, as
          our host informed us, were Greeks and Rhetoricians—the third, a
          Patrician of the house of the Pontii, devoted, like himself, to the
          pursuits of philosophy and the pleasures of a literary
          retirement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were
          engaged, when we joined them, in a conversation which had sprung
          from the perusal of some new metaphysical treatise. One of the
          Greeks, the more serene-looking of the pair, was defending its
          doctrines with earnestness of manner, although in a low and
          measured cadence of voice; the other espoused the opposite side,
          with quickness of utterance and severe animation of look; while the
          two lordly Romans seemed to be contenting themselves, for the most
          part, with listening, although it was not difficult to perceive
          from their countenances, that the one sided in opinion with the
          Stoic, and Capito himself with the Epicurean.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They all arose
          presently, and proceeded to walk together, without interrupting the
          conversation, along the same shaded avenue which Sextus and myself
          had already traversed. He and I moved along with them, but a little
          in their rear—my companion being still too much abstracted to
          bestow his attention on what they were saying; while I myself,
          being but little an adept in such mysteries, amused myself rather
          with the exterior and manners of the men, than with the merits of
          the opinions they were severally defending. The <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Greeks were attired in the graceful
          costume of their country, which was worn, however, far more
          gracefully by the Epicurean than his brother,—the materials of his
          robe being delicate, and its folds arranged with studied elegance,
          whereas the coarse garment of the Stoic had apparently engaged less
          attention. Nevertheless, there was a more marked difference between
          the attire of Capito and that of Pontius Mamurra; for the former
          was arrayed in a tunic of the whitest cloth, beneath which appeared
          fine linen rollers, swathing his thighs and legs, to protect them,
          as I supposed, from the heat and the insects, and a pair of
          slippers, of dark violet-coloured cloth, embroidered with silver
          flowers; while the other held his arms folded in the drapery of an
          old but genuine toga, which left his yet strong and sinewy nether
          limbs exposed to the weather, all except what was covered by his
          tall black sandals and their senatorian crescents.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we passed on,
          our host from time to time directed the attention of his visiters,
          more particularly of the two Greeks, to the statues of bronze and
          marble, which were placed at convenient intervals along the
          terraces of his garden. The symmetry of these figures, and the
          graceful simplicity of their attitudes, inspired me with I know not
          what of calm and soothing pleasure such as I had never before
          tasted, so that I thought I could have lingered for ever amidst
          these haunts of philosophic luxury. The images were, for the most
          part, portraits of illustrious men—Greeks, Romans—sages and heroes;
          but beautiful female forms were not wanting, nor majestic
          representations of gods and demi-gods, and all the ethereal
          imaginations of the Grecian poets. Seeing the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>name of Jupiter inscribed upon one of
          the pedestals, I paused for a moment to contemplate the glorious
          personification of might and wisdom, depositing, at the same time,
          a handful of roses at the feet of the statue—upon which I could
          observe that my behaviour furnished some mirth to the Epicurean
          Demochares; while, on the contrary, Euphranor, the disciple of the
          Porch, approved of what I did, and rebuked his companion for saying
          any thing that might even by possibility disturb the natural piety
          of an innocent youth. But the Roman Stoic stood by with a smile of
          stately scorn; and utter indifference was painted on the
          countenance of Capito. At another time, Sextus having staid behind
          to examine the beauties of a certain statue of Diana, which
          represented the goddess stretched out in careless slumber on the
          turf, with a slender grayhound at her feet, the Epicurean began to
          rally me on having a taste inferior to that of my friend, whose
          devotion, he said, could not be blamed, being paid to an exquisite
          imitation of what the great Nature of things had decreed should
          ever be the most agreeable of all objects in the eyes of a person
          of his age.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Whereas you,”</span> continued
          he, <span class="tei tei-q">“appear to be more occupied with
          deep-hung eye-brows, ambrosial beards, and fantastic thunderbolts,
          and the other exuberances of Homeric imagination.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this reproach
          I made no reply, but Capito immediately began to recite some verses
          of a Hymn of Calimachus, in which both the Greeks joined him; nor
          could any thing be more delightful than the harmonious numbers. A
          sudden exclamation of my friend, however, interrupted them, and
          Capito, looking up a long <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg
          35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>straight pathway, said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come, Valerius, we shall see whether you or Sextus is
          the more gallant to living beauties, for here come my nieces. I
          assure you, I know not of which of them I am the more proud; but
          Sempronia has more of the Diana about her, so it is probable she
          may find a ready slave in our Sextus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We advanced, and
          the uncle, having tenderly saluted them, soon presented us to their
          notice. Sextus blushed deeply when he found himself introduced to
          Sempronia, while in her smile, although she looked at him as if to
          say she had never seen him before, I thought I could detect a
          certain half-suppressed something of half-disdainful archness—the
          colour in her cheeks, at the same time, being not entirely unmoved.
          She was, indeed, a very lovely girl, and in looking on her light
          dancing play of features, I could easily sympathize with the young
          raptures of my friend. Her dress was such as to set off her charms
          to the utmost advantage, for the bright green of her Byssine robe,
          although it would have been a severe trial to any ordinary
          complexion, served only to heighten the delicious brilliancy of
          hers. A veil, of the same substance and colour, richly embroidered
          with flowers of silver tissue, fell in flowing drapery well-nigh to
          her knees. Her hair was almost entirely concealed by this part of
          her dress, but a single braid of the brightest nut-brown was
          visible low down on her polished forehead. Her eyes were black as
          jet, and full of a nymph-like vivacity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other,
          Athanasia, was not a dazzling beauty. Taller than her cousin, and
          darker-haired, but with eyes rather light than otherwise, of a
          clear, somewhat melancholy gray—with a complexion paler than is
          usual in Italy, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg
          36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
          demeanour hovering between cheerfulness and innocent gravity, and
          attired with a vestal simplicity in the old Roman tunic, and cloak
          of white cloth—it is possible that most men might have regarded her
          less than the other. A single star of diamonds, planted high up
          among her black hair, was the only ornament she wore.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the request
          of the younger lady, we all returned to the grotto, in the
          neighbourhood of which, as I have already mentioned, our tasteful
          host had placed the rarest of his exotic plants, some of which
          Sempronia was now desirous of inspecting. As we paced again slowly
          over those smooth-shaven alleys of turf, and between those rows of
          yews and box, clipped into regular shapes, which abounded in this
          more artificial region, the conversation, which the appearance of
          the cousins had disturbed, was resumed; although, as out of regard
          to their presence, the voices of the disputants preserved a lower
          and milder tone than before. I must confess, however, that mild as
          was the manner of the discourse, I could not help being somewhat
          astonished, that a polite Roman could permit such topics to be
          discussed in the hearing of females; above all, that he did not
          interpose to prevent Demochares from throwing out so many sarcastic
          reflections concerning the deities whose statues decorated the
          garden. A beautiful Mercury, in particular, which we all paused to
          admire, elicited many observations, that I could easily see were
          far from being agreeable to the fair cousins. But greatest of all
          was my wonder at the behaviour of Capito himself, who, after we had
          again entered that delightful grotto, turned himself to me as if
          peculiarly, and began <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg
          37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
          deliberate and ingenious piece of declamation concerning the tenets
          of his favourite philosophy;—such as the fortuitous concourse of
          atoms, the transitory and fluctuating nature of all things, and the
          necessity of snatching present enjoyments, as nothing permanent can
          be discovered whereon to repose the mind. With great elegance,
          indeed, did he enlarge on these golden theories, nor did he fail to
          intersperse his discourse with many exquisite verses from Lucretius
          and other poetical followers of his sect. Such, however, was the
          earnestness of his declamation, that I could not help believing him
          to be quite sincere to what he said, and asked him, not without
          anxiety, whether he had all his life been an Epicurean, or whether
          it was only of late that he had espoused that discipline.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Valerius,”</span> said he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the question is not discreditable to your tender age
          and provincial education. To be born wise, Fate or Heaven has
          denied to the human race. It is their privilege to win wisdom for
          themselves; the fault is their own, if they do not die wise. When
          the stripling enters upon the theatre of the world, bright hopes
          are around him, and he moves onward in the buoyancy of conscious
          power. The pride of young existence is the essence and extract of
          all his innumerable sensations. Rejoicing in the feeling of the
          real might that is, it is his delight to think—to dream—of might
          existing and exerted as for ever. New to the material, but still
          more to the moral world, he believes in the stability of all things
          whose transitory nature has not been exhibited before him. New to
          the tricks of mankind, he believes that to be said truly, which,
          why it should be said falsely, he is unable to conjecture. For him,
          superstition has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg
          38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>equal potency to darken the past, and
          illuminate the future. At that early period, when ignorance is of
          itself sufficient to produce a certain happiness, the ambition is
          too high to admit such doctrines as I have no shame in avowing. But
          time moves on, and every hour some tender plant is crushed beneath
          his tread. The spirit clings long to its delusions. The promise
          that is destroyed to-day springs into life to-morrow in some new
          shape; and Hope, like some warring deity of your poets, bleeds and
          sickens only to revive again. But disappointment at length gathers
          to itself the vigour of an enduring form. The horizon becomes
          colder around us—the soul waxes faint and more faint within. It is
          then that man begins to recognize the true state, not of his own
          nature alone, but of all things that surround him—that having
          tasted much of evil, he is taught to feel the value of good—and
          weaning himself from vain-glorious dreams, learns the great lesson
          of wisdom, to enjoy the moments as they pass—to snatch some solid
          pleasure, at least, amidst a world of vision and imagination; so,
          in a word, as the poet has expressed it, he may not have reason to
          complain in the hour of death that he has never lived.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In me,”</span> he continued, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you behold one that has gone through the experience
          necessary to produce an entire acquiescence in these doctrines. I
          am one of those, Valerius, who have resolved to concentrate, after
          this fashion, the whole of my dreams upon the hour that is. There
          are not wanting, indeed, here and elsewhere, persons who profess
          the same theories, only in the view of finding excuse and shelter
          for the practice of vice. But till it be proved that the practice
          of vice <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name=
          "Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is the best means of
          enjoyment, in vain shall it be asserted that our doctrine is
          essentially adverse to virtue. The mistakes or the misdeeds of
          individuals must be estimated for nothing; for where is the
          doctrine that may not be shewn to have been defended by impure
          livers? The founder of our sect is acknowledged, by its most
          virulent enemies, to have been the most blameless of men, and they,
          I must take leave to believe, can never be sincere friends of
          virtue, who doubt, that he who is a true worshipper of pleasure,
          may also be the worshipper of virtue.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          certain something, as I thought, more like suppressed melancholy
          than genuine hilarity, in the expression of the old man’s face, as
          well as in the tone of his voice, while he gave utterance to these
          sentiments; nor did any of those present appear desirous of
          protracting the argument; although I did not imagine from their
          looks that any of them had altered their opinion. What, however, I
          could not help remarking in a particular manner, was the gentle
          regret painted in the countenance of the elder niece, while Capito
          was speaking. The maiden sate over against him all the while, her
          cheek supported on her left hand, with an expression of tender
          affection. From time to time, indeed, she cast her eye upward with
          a calm smile, but immediately resumed her attitude of pensive
          abstraction. Her uncle took her hand in his when he had done
          speaking, and kissed it gently, as if to apologize for having said
          any thing disagreeable to her. She smiled again upon the sceptic,
          and walked by herself, (for I could not help following her with my
          eye,) down into a dark walk of pines that branched off <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at the right hand from the entrance into
          the grotto. There I saw her stoop and pluck a pale flower. This she
          placed in her bosom, and then rejoined us with a more cheerful
          aspect; after which, we all walked towards the villa. Nor did it
          escape my notice, that, although Sempronia appeared willing to
          avoid Sextus as we went, it always happened, by some accident or
          other, that he was nearer to her than any other person of the
          company.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were both
          at a little distance behind the rest of the party, when Euphranor
          addressed himself to me, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not
          this youth, your companion, the same that is under the guidance of
          a certain Xerophrastes?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
          same,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“and a wary,
          sage-looking Athenian is his tutor. I believe he also is of the
          Porch.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“No doubt,”</span>
          interrupted Demochares; <span class="tei tei-q">“he has a beard
          that Zeno might have been proud of, and walks as if he conceived
          himself to be the chief pillar of the Porch, if not the Porch
          itself.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Who shall prevent
          Demochares from having his jest?”</span> replied Euphranor.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The man is by birth a Thessalian, and his
          gutturals still remind one strongly of his native hills.”</span>—I
          would gladly have heard more of it, but he was interrupted by the
          nearer approach of the rest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the hour
          of taking the bath, we exercised ourselves for some time in the
          tennis-court, where I could not but admire, especially after having
          heard Capito philosophise, the vigour and agility displayed by him
          as well as his companions. I was then conducted into the baths,
          where, after being washed and perfumed in the most luxurious
          manner, I was arrayed in an elegant supper-garment by one of the
          slaves of our host. At table we were joined again by the ladies,
          who both reclined on the same couch with their uncle. Three comely
          youths attended us, in short tunics, and girt with napkins of fine
          linen; but, during the repast, an ancient female slave stood in
          silence behind the couch of the young ladies. A small fountain of
          alabaster played between two tall candelabra of the same material,
          at the farther end of the apartment; and a young damsel stood
          beside them, swinging slowly from time to time a silver censer,
          from which clouds of delicate odour rolled up to the mirrored
          roof.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all things
          the feast was splendid; but there was no appearance of useless or
          vain ostentation. Every thing was conducted in a style of great
          calmness and order, without the least formality. The repast
          inter<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name=
          "Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rupted not the
          conversation, which went on in a manner to me equally instructive
          as entertaining; although I must confess the presence of Athanasia
          sometimes rendered me inattentive to what was spoken. I could not
          divest myself of the idea, that some unknown circumstance was
          pressing on the mind of the fair creature, and that when she smiled
          upon those who addressed her, it was sometimes to conceal her
          ignorance of that which had been said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Being asked by
          Capito, I endeavoured, among other things, to inform him and his
          friends, as far as I could, concerning the then condition of this
          island, which, more particularly after the exploits of Agricola,
          had come to be a subject of some interest. In return, the chief
          topics which then occupied the capital were discussed by them, as I
          perceived, in a great measure on my account; and I listened with
          delight to the praises, which they all agreed on bestowing on the
          new Emperor. Many anecdotes were narrated, which tended to
          strengthen the feelings of admiration, with which I had already
          been accustomed to contemplate his character. But others were told,
          as the conversation went on, which I could not so easily reconcile
          with the idea I had formed of him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For example, I
          was somewhat disturbed with what they told me concerning his
          treatment of the Christians, who, as we understood in Britain, had
          been suffered to live in tranquillity ever since Nerva acceded to
          the empire. But now, from the circumstances related, it appeared
          that the mild and humane Trajan had taken up, in regard to this
          sect, the whole aversion of Domitian; every day some cruel
          catastrophe was made known <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg
          43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
          some person who had adopted their tenets. Being ignorant of the
          nature of those tenets, and having heard only in general terms that
          they were of Jewish origin, dark, and mystical, I was at a loss to
          account for the extreme hatred of the Prince, or rather for his
          condescending to give himself so much trouble concerning a matter
          so obscure and seemingly trifling.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Capito, however,
          assured me, that although I might have good occasion to wonder at
          the steps taken by the Emperor, it would no longer be said by any
          one, that the progress of the Christian sect deserved to be
          considered as a matter either of obscurity, or of no consequence.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“On the contrary,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“from what you have just heard of the
          numbers and quality of those that have lately suffered various
          punishments, you cannot hesitate to admit that the head of the
          empire has been justified in considering it as a subject worthy his
          attention.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We have adopted the gods of many nations,”</span> said
          Pontius Mamurra, <span class="tei tei-q">“nor do I see why, because
          the Jews have been unfortunate in a contest with Rome, we should
          take it for granted that theirs are unworthy of respect. If,
          however, as we have heard asserted, he who embraces this creed
          becomes an infidel in regard to the deities of Rome, I say Cæsar
          does well in refusing toleration to the intolerant superstition.
          Domitian was a tyrant, and a monster of humanity; the late prince
          was wise and good; and yet it may be, that, in regard to these
          Christians, the principle of Domitian’s conduct was right in the
          main, and that of Nerva’s wrong. But you, Capito, regard both sides
          of the question, I have no doubt, with the same
          indifference.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg
          44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I hope,”</span> replied Capito, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I shall never regard with indifference any question,
          in which the interest of the empire and the honour of Trajan are
          concerned. But if you mean only that I am indifferent about the
          nature of this Syrian superstition, you are in the right. I have no
          knowledge of its dogmas, nor desire to have. I presume they have
          their share of that old eastern barbarity, in the shady places of
          which the elder Greeks used to think they could discover the
          outlines of something really grand and majestic.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It may be so,”</span> said Mamurra; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“but if the superstition be found dangerous to the
          state, the Prince does well in repressing its progress. That is the
          only question of which I spake.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There is, indeed, no other,”</span> said Capito;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I thought of none.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And how do you answer it, dear uncle?”</span> said
          Athanasia, (lifting herself up, for the first time, to take part in
          the conversation.)—<span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, my love,”</span>
          said the old man, <span class="tei tei-q">“to answer that is the
          business of Cæsar, and of the Senate. I only regret, that blood
          should be shed, and citizens exiled; above all, in the reign of a
          just and merciful Prince.—Sempronia,”</span> continued he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“what is that strange story your father was
          telling about one of the daughters of Serennius?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They only allege,”</span> replied Sempronia, with a
          smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“that Tertulla had a flirtation with
          a handsome young Greek, and the Greek happened to be a
          Christian,—and she was converted by the Greek,—and she was found
          out in going with him to some secret assembly of these people, in a
          vault by the Vatican Hill,—and her father has been glad to send her
          to Corsica, partly to escape the lawyers, and partly, I suppose, in
          hopes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name=
          "Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that the quietness of
          the island, and the absence of handsome young Christians, may
          perhaps, in time, restore poor Tertulla to her right mind—This is
          all. Do you think that a strange story, uncle?”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Not, if it be exactly as you have told it, Sempronia.
          What says Athanasia?”</span> Athanasia answered gravely, that she
          was sorry for Tertulla, and had never heard any thing of the young
          Greek before.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time,
          the increasing darkness of the chamber had warned me that we ought
          to be thinking of our return. I had more than once looked towards
          Sextus, but he refused to meet my eye. When I was on the point of
          speaking, Sempronia, starting from her couch, exclaimed, that she
          was sure there was thunder in the skies; and presently flash after
          flash gleamed along the horizon. All sat silent, as if awe-struck;
          but Sempronia was the only one that seemed to be in terror from the
          tempest. Nevertheless, my eyes rested more on Athanasia, who looked
          paler than she had done, although her countenance preserved its
          serenity. <span class="tei tei-q">“How awful,”</span> said I,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“is the voice of Jupiter!”</span> Athanasia
          folded her arms upon her bosom, and lifting her eyes to heaven,
          said in a whisper,—<span class="tei tei-q">“How awful is the voice
          of God!”</span> She then dropt her hand on the end of her couch,
          and half unconsciously taking hold of it in mine, I asked her if
          she was afraid. <span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said she,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not afraid, but the heaviness of the
          air makes me faint, and I never can listen to thunder without
          feeling something extraordinary within me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Capito said, he
          could not think of our going into the city that evening, and that
          we must all make up our minds to remain in the villa. The
          countenance of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg
          46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Sextus brightened up, and he looked to me as
          if to ask my assent. I was easily persuaded, and our host
          despatched a messenger to inform Licinius of the cause of our
          absence. The old man then led us into another apartment, which was
          richly furnished with books and paintings. Here he read for some
          time out of one of the poets, to a party, none of whom, I am
          afraid, were very attentive in listening to him, till, the hour of
          rest being come, we were conducted to our several apartments,
          Sextus and myself, indeed, being lodged in the same chamber.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We were no
          sooner left alone than I began to rally my friend on the beauty of
          his mistress, and the earnest court he had been paying her. The
          youth listened with blushes of delight to her praises, but seemed
          not to have the least idea that he had been so fortunate as to make
          any impression on her mind. On the contrary, he scarcely appeared
          to be aware of having done any thing to attract attention from her,
          and expressed astonishment when I assured him, that his behaviour
          had been such as could not possibly admit of more than one
          explanation in the eyes of a person so quick and vivacious as the
          lovely Sempronia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After we had
          both retired to our beds, and the lights were extinguished, we
          still continued for some time to talk over the incidents of our
          visit, and the future prospects of Sextus and his love; until at
          length sleep overpowered us in easy bonds, and agreeable dreams
          followed, I doubt not, in the hearts of us both, the thoughts and
          sights of a delightful day. Mine surely were delightful, for they
          were all of Athanasia. Yet, even in the visions of the night, I

          47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on
          her face without some strange impression of mystery. I saw her
          placid smile—I heard the sweet low cadence of her voice—but I felt,
          and I could not feel it without a certain indescribable anxiety,
          that her deep thoughts were far away.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I awoke early,
          and drew near to the bed of Sextus; but seeing that he was fast
          asleep, and that a quiet smile was on his lips, I could not think
          of awakening him. The sun shone bright into the apartment, and I
          resolved to walk forth and breathe the balmy air of the garden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moisture was
          still heavy on the green paths, and the birds were singing among
          glittering leaves; the god-like statues stood unscathed in their
          silent beauty. I walked to and fro, enjoying the enchantment of the
          scene;—a new feeling of the beauty of all things seemed to have
          been breathed into my soul; and the pensive grace of Athanasia
          hovered over my imagination, like some presiding genius of the
          groves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I found myself
          near the favourite grotto, and had stood over against its entrance
          for some space, contemplating the augmented stream as it fell from
          the superincumbent rock, and regretting the ravage which the
          nightly tempest had made among the delicate flowers round its
          basin. Twice I thought I heard the murmurs of a voice, and twice I
          persuaded myself that it was only the rippling of the waters; but
          the third time I was satisfied that some person must be near. I
          passed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name=
          "Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>between the water and
          the rock, and beheld the fair creature that had been occupying so
          many of my thoughts, kneeling far within the grotto, as it seemed,
          in supplication. To disturb her by advancing farther, would have
          been impious; to retire, without the risk of disturbing her, almost
          impossible; but I remained there fixed to the spot, without perhaps
          considering all these things as I should have done. The virgin
          modesty of her attitude was holy in my eyes, and the thought never
          occurred to me, that I might be doing wrong in permitting myself to
          witness the simple devotions of Athanasia. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Great God, listen to my prayers,”</span> was all I
          understood of what she said; but she whispered for some moments in
          a lowly and fervent tone, and I saw that she kissed something with
          her lips ere she arose from her knees. She then plunged her hands
          into the well, by whose brink she had knelt, and turned round to
          the light. <span class="tei tei-q">“Athanasia, forgive me,”</span>
          was already on my lips; but on seeing me, she uttered a faint cry
          and fell prostrate upon the marble. I rushed forward, lifted up her
          head, and laved water from the fountain, till I saw her lips
          tremble. At last she opened her eyes, and after gazing on me wildly
          for a moment, she gathered her strength, and stood quite upright,
          supporting herself against the wall of the grotto. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Great heavens!”</span> cried I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in what have I offended, that I should be rendered the
          cause of affliction to Athanasia? Speak, lady, and say that you
          forgive me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I thought,”</span> said she, with a proud calmness,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that Valerius was of Roman—of Patrician
          blood. What brings him to be a spy upon the secret moments of a
          Patrician maiden?”</span>—Then bursting into a tone of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>unutterable fervour, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Speak,”</span> said she, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“young man, what have you heard? How long have you
          stood here? Am I betrayed?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Witness, heaven and earth!”</span> cried I, kneeling,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and witness every god, that I have heard
          nothing, except to know that you were praying. I have only seen you
          kneeling, and been guilty of gazing on your beauty.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You heard not the words of my
          prayer?”</span> said she. <span class="tei tei-q">“No, not its
          words, Athanasia, nor any thing of its purpose.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Do you swear this to me, young
          man?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, I swear by Jupiter and
          by Rome—as I am a man and a Roman, I know not, neither do I desire
          to know, any thing of what you said. Forgive me for the fault of my
          indiscretion—you have no other to forgive.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Athanasia paused
          for a moment, and then resuming more of her usual tone of voice,
          (although its accents were still somewhat disturbed and faltering,)
          said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">“Valerius, since the thing is
          so, I have nothing to forgive. It is you that must pardon me for my
          suspicion.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Distress me not,
          Athanasia,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“by speaking
          such words.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“From this hour,
          then,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“what has passed
          here is forgotten. We blot it from our memories;”</span>—and with
          that, as if in token of the paction, she extended to me her hand. I
          kissed it as I knelt, and swore that all things were safe with me;
          but added, as I arose, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I was afraid I
          should be promising more than I should be able to perform,—did I
          say I should be able to forget any hour, or any place, where I had
          seen Athanasia.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> said
          she, <span class="tei tei-q">“no compliment, or I shall begin to
          suspect you of insincerity.”</span> I was then about to withdraw
          from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg
          51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>grotto; but seeing a scroll of parchment lying
          at the feet of Athanasia, I stooped, and presented it to her,
          saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was afraid she might forget
          it.”</span> She took it eagerly, and saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of that there was no danger,”</span> placed it in her
          bosom, within the folds of her tunic. She was then gathering up her
          black tresses, and fastening them hastily on the back part of her
          head, when we heard the sound of footsteps not far off, and
          beckoning to me to remain where I was, she darted from me, and in a
          moment vanished among the trees. I waited for a few minutes, and
          then stepping forth, beheld her walking at a distance, beside her
          sister, in the direction of the villa. They were soon lost among
          the paths, and I returned alone into the grotto.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I sat down
          beside the dark well, wherein she had dipt her hands, and mused in
          a most disturbed mood on all the particulars of this strange and
          unexpected interview. Every motion of her features—every modulation
          of her voice, was present with me; I had gathered them all into my
          heart, and I felt that I must cherish them there for ever. From the
          first moment I saw her, my eyes had been constrained to gaze upon
          her with an interest quite novel to me; but now I knew that she
          could not smile, without making my heart faint within me, and that
          the least whisper of her voice was able to bring tears into mine
          eyes. Now I thought of my own unworthiness, and could not help
          saying to myself, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why should a poor
          ignorant provincial, such as I am, be torturing myself with the
          thoughts of such a creature as this?”</span> Then, again, some
          benign glance of hers would return before me, and I could not help
          having some faint hopes, that her <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>innocent heart might be won to me by faithful
          unwearied love. But what always threw me back into despair, was the
          recollection of the mystery that I knew hung over her mind,
          although what it was I could not know. That she had been saying
          something in her prayers which could not be overheard without
          betraying her, she had herself confessed. What could be this
          secret, so cherished in dread, and in darkness?—A crime?—No crime
          could sully the clear bosom of her innocence. No consciousness of
          guilt could be concealed beneath that heavenly visage. But perhaps
          she had been made the confidante of some erring,—some unhappy
          friend. Perhaps, in her prayer, she had made mention of another’s
          name, and implored the pardon of another’s guilt. Last of all, why
          might it not be so, that the maiden loved, and was beloved again;
          that she might have some reason to regard any casual betrayal of
          her affection as a calamity; and that, having uttered the name of
          her lover in her secret supplications, her terrors might all have
          been occasioned by her apprehensions of my having overheard it? And
          yet there was something in the demeanour of Athanasia, that I could
          not bring myself to reconcile entirely with any one of these
          suppositions. Had she feared that I had overheard any confession of
          guilt,—even of the guilt of another,—surely some semblance of shame
          would have been mingled with her looks of terror. Had she
          apprehended only the discovery of an innocent love, surely her
          blushes would have been deeper, and her boldness less. Yet the last
          solution of the difficulty was that which haunted me the most
          powerfully.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When I came
          forth into the open air, I perceived <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>that the sun was already high in heaven, and
          proceeded in haste towards the villa, not doubting that Sextus and
          Capito would be astonished by the length of my absence. I found
          them and the ladies walking under the northern colonnade, having
          returned, as they told me, from a fruitless search after me through
          almost the whole of the garden. I looked to Athanasia, as if to
          signify that she well knew where I might have been found; but,
          although I saw that she understood my meaning, she said nothing in
          explanation. Sextus drew me aside shortly after, and told me, that
          his father had sent to inform him, that our presence was necessary
          in the city before supper-time, to attend a great entertainment
          which was to be given that evening by the lady whose cause he had
          successfully pleaded in the Forum on the preceding day; which lady,
          I now for the first time learned, was no other than the same Marcia
          Rubellia, to whom his father was very anxious the youth should be
          married. The success of this pleading had increased very much the
          wealth of the lady, and, of course, as Sextus well knew, the
          anxiety of Licinius for the proposed union; and to remain at the
          villa any longer, was, he said, entirely impossible, since he
          already suspected his father had not been quite pleased with him
          for leaving the Forum the day before, without staying to hear out a
          cause in which his duty, if not his inclination, ought to have made
          him feel so greatly interested.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We bade adieu,
          therefore, to our kind host and the young ladies, not without more
          reluctance than either of us durst express, and ready promises to
          return soon again to the villa. We found Dromo and Boto waiting
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054"
          id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for us at the gate, the
          former of whom looked unutterable things, while the latter appeared
          to be as joyful in seeing me again, as if we had been parted for a
          twelvemonth. The two slaves were mounted on asses, but they led
          horses for our conveyance; so we mounted with all speed, and were
          soon beyond the beautiful enclosures of Capito. As soon as we were
          fairly out of sight of the house, Dromo began to ply Sextus with
          innumerable questions about the result of the visit, all of them in
          bad Greek; that, as he said, there might be no chance of what
          passed being understood by the Druid; for by that venerable
          designation, he informed us, the primitive Boto had already come to
          be best known in the vestibule of Licinius. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span> quoth he, <span class="tei tei-q">“there
          is no need for many words; I am sure my young master has not been
          behindhand with himself. If he has, it is no fault of mine,
          however. I put Opportunity into his hands, and she, you know, as
          the poets say, has only one lock of hair, and that is in
          front.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sextus being
          very shy of entering into particulars, I found myself obliged to
          take upon me the satisfying of the curiosity of this inquisitive
          varlet, which I did in a manner that much astonished Sextus, who by
          no means suspected, that in the midst of my own attention to the
          other cousin, I had been able to take so much notice of what passed
          between him and Sempronia. However, the gentle youth took a little
          raillery all in good part, and we laughed loudly in unison at the
          triumphant capers which the whip of Dromo made his poor ass
          exhibit, in testimony of his satisfaction with the progress which
          all things appeared to be making. We <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>reached the city about three hours after noon,
          and were told by the slaves in attendance, that Xerophrastes had
          gone out some time before, and that Licinius was already busy in
          arraying himself for the feast of Rubellia.</p>

          VII.</span></span></h1>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her mansion was
          situated about the middle of the Suburra, in a neighbourhood nowise
          splendid, and itself distinguished, on the side fronting to the
          street, by no uncommon marks of elegance or opulence. A plain brick
          wall covered almost the whole of the building from the eye of the
          passenger; and what was seen deserved the praise of neatness,
          rather than of magnificence. Nevertheless, the moment one had
          passed the gate, and entered the court, one could not help
          perceiving, that taste and wealth had been alike expended
          abundantly on the residence; for the broad terrace and gallery
          behind were lavishly adorned, the one with sculpture and the other
          with paintings; and the gardens, which these overlooked, appeared
          to be both extensive and elaborate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We were
          conducted through several pillared halls, and then up a wide
          staircase, of somewhat sombre magnificence, into the chamber where
          the company were already in part assembled, and busy in offering
          their congratulations to the mistress of the feast. She was so much
          engaged with their flatteries that she did not at first perceive
          our entrance; but as soon as she knew who had come, the chief part
          of her attention <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg
          57]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was
          divided between her victorious advocate and his blushing son.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rapidly as we
          have been advancing in our imitation of the manners of the capital,
          our island, most unquestionably, has never yet displayed any thing
          that could sustain the smallest comparison with what then met my
          eyes in the stately saloon of this widow. The group around her was
          gay and various, and she was worthy of forming its centre; young
          and handsome, dressed in a style of the utmost splendour, her
          deportment equally elegant and vivacious. Her complexion was of
          that clear rich brown which lends to the eye a greater brilliancy
          than the most exquisite contrast of red and white; and over which
          the blood, when it does come into the face, diffuses at once the
          warmest and the deepest of blushes. Her hair appeared to be
          perfectly black, unless where the light, streaming from behind,
          gave an edging of glossy brown to the thick masses of her curls.
          Her robe of crimson silk was fastened by a girdle, which seemed to
          consist of nothing but rubies and emeralds, strung upon threads of
          gold. She wore a tiara that rose high above her tresses, and was
          all over resplendent with flowers woven in jewellery; and around
          her delicate wrists and ankles were twined broad chains of virgin
          gold, interspersed with alternate wreaths of sapphire. Her form was
          the perfection of luxury; and although I have said that her
          deportment was in general lively and brilliant, yet there was a
          soft seriousness that every now and then settled in her eyes, which
          gave her, for a moment, a look of melancholy that seemed to me more
          likely to be in harmony with the secret nature of her disposition.
          I watched her in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg
          58]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>particular when she spoke to Sextus; her full
          rich-toned voice was then merry, and her large eyes sparkled; but
          when she was engaged with any other person, she could not help
          gazing on the beautiful youth in silence; and then it was that her
          countenance wore its deepest expression of calmness—I had almost
          said, of sadness.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had been
          gazing on her, I know not how long, from another part of the room,
          when I heard a hearty chuckle from behind me, and thought I could
          not be unacquainted with the voice. Looking round, I saw, not
          without delight, the stately figure of my Prætorian Captain,
          Sabinus, whose cheerful eye soon distinguished me, and who
          forthwith came up to salute me in the most friendly manner. I
          introduced him to Licinius and Sextus, the former of whom expressed
          himself as being much gratified with the attention the centurion
          had shewn to me during our voyage; so that I felt myself, as it
          were, no longer a stranger in the place; and the lutes and trumpets
          at that moment announcing that supper was ready to be served up, I
          took care to keep close to Sabinus, and to place myself near him on
          the couch.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The room in
          which the feast was prepared, communicated by a pair of brazen
          folding doors, richly sculptured, with that in which the company
          had assembled; but from it, although the sun had not yet gone down,
          all light was excluded, excepting what streamed from golden
          candelabra, and broad lamps of bronze suspended overhead from the
          high and painted ceiling. The party might consist of about twenty,
          who reclined along one demi-circular couch, the covers of which
          were of the softest down, and the frame-work inlaid with
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg059"
          id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ivory;—the part of the room
          enclosed by its outline being occupied with the table, and an open
          space to which the attendants had free access. We had no sooner
          taken our seats than a crowd of slaves entered, carrying large
          boards upon their heads, which being forthwith arranged on the
          table, were seen to be loaded with dishes of gold and silver, and
          all manner of drinking vessels, also with vases of rare flowers,
          and urns of perfume. But how did the countenance of Sabinus
          brighten, when the trumpet sounded a second time as if from below,
          and the floor of the chamber was suddenly, as it were, pierced in
          twain, and the pealing music ushered up a huge roasted boar, all
          wreathed with stately garnishings, and standing erect on his golden
          platform as on a chariot of triumph! <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!
          my dear boy,”</span> cries he, <span class="tei tei-q">“here comes
          the true king of beasts, and only legitimate monarch of the woods.
          What should we not have given for a slice of him when we were pent
          up, half-starved and fainting, in that abominable ship of ours?—All
          hail, most potent conqueror! but whether Germanic or Asiatic be thy
          proper title, I shall soon know, when that expert Ionian has
          daintily carved and divided thee.”</span> But why should I attempt
          to describe to you the particulars of the feast? Let it suffice,
          that whatever idea I had formed of Roman profusion was surpassed,
          and that the splendour of the entertainment engaged the attention
          of all except Rubellia herself, who, reclining immediately above
          Sextus, kept her eyes fixed almost all the time it lasted, upon his
          luxuriant curls of dark hair, unless when she caused the young
          damsel, her cup-bearer, to pour out to her wine in a goblet of
          onyx, which she touched <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg
          60]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>with her lips, and then handed to the
          indifferent boy. When the supper was half over, the folding-doors
          were again thrown open, and there entered a group of maidens and
          beautiful youths, who danced before us to the music of the lute,
          and scattered crowns of roses at the feet of Rubellia and her
          guests. She herself placed one of them on the head of Sextus, and
          another on that of his father, who lay on the other side of her,
          and then caused a large cup of wine to be carried all around,
          whereof each of us tasted, and drank to the health of the orator,
          in whose honour the entertainment was made. The ladies that were
          present imitated the example of the hostess, and crowned such as
          were by them; but Sabinus and I, not being near enough to any of
          them, received that courtesy from some of the dancing maidens.
          Libations were poured out abundantly on the marble floor, and all
          the gods were invoked to shower down their blessings on Rubellia,
          and those that had been so fortunate as to serve her. Sweet strains
          of music resounded through the tall pillars of the banqueting-room,
          and the lamps burned heavily in an atmosphere overloaded with
          perfumes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appeared to
          me, from the beginning, that my friend Sabinus witnessed, not
          without some feelings of displeasure, the excessive attentions
          which Rubellia lavished on young Sextus; and I gathered, from the
          way in which he every now and then looked towards them during the
          supper, that, had the place permitted, he would not have allowed
          such things to go on without some comment. But when we had left the
          banqueting-room, and removed to another apartment, where, amidst
          various entertainments of dancing, music, and recita<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tion, Rubellia still retained close to
          herself the heir of Licinius, the centurion made to himself
          abundant amends for the previous restraint to which his temper had
          been subjected. <span class="tei tei-q">“Confess now,”</span> said
          he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that she is a lovely creature, and
          that your British beauties are tame and insipid, when compared with
          such a specimen of Roman fascination; and confess, withal, that
          this curled boy is either the most ignorant, or the most
          insusceptible of his sex. Good heavens! in what a different style
          was she treated by the old magistrate, whose very bust there, in
          the corner, looks quite blank and disconsolate with its great white
          eyes, while she, that sate for so many months pale and weeping by
          his bed-side, is thinking of nothing but to bestow all the wealth
          he left her on a beardless stripling, who appears to regard the
          bust and the beauty with almost equal indifference.—Alas! poor old
          withered Leberinus, little did you imagine that so small a phial
          would suffice to hold all her tears. My only wonder is, that she
          still permits your marble image to occupy even a corner of her
          mansion; but, no doubt, you will soon be sent on your travels. I
          dare say, some cold pedestal in the garden will, ere long, be the
          best birth you need look for.—Well, well, you see what fools we may
          be made by the cunning of these pretty crocodiles. I trust my
          dotage, when it does come, will not shew itself in the same shape
          with that of my good old friend. I hope the ghost of the worthy
          Prætor will not frown unseen the night she takes this Adonis to her
          arms. If I were in his place, I should give her curtains a pretty
          shake. By Hermes! it would not be a pretty monument and a flowery
          epitaph that would make me lie still.”</span></p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How long is it,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“since this venerable magistrate died? Surely she has
          allowed him the decency of a tenmonth’s grief, before she began to
          give suppers, and perceive the beauty of Sextus?”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Whether it be a tenmonth ago or
          not,”</span> replied the Centurion, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
          more than I can take upon me to decide; all I know is, that it
          appears to me as if it were but yesterday that I supped here, (it
          was just before I set off for Britain,) and saw the young lady
          reclining, even at table, with those long black curls of her’s, in
          the bosom of the emaciated Leberinus. By Jupiter! the old man would
          not taste a drop of wine unless she kissed the cup—she coaxed every
          morsel he swallowed down his throat, and clasped the garland round
          his bald pate with her own fingers; ay, twice before that sleek
          physician—that solemn-faced Greek, whom you see at this moment
          talking with your kinsman, advised her to have him carried to his
          bed. For all the gravity of his looks, I would lay a trifle, that
          worthy Bœotian has his own thoughts about what is passing, as well
          as I. But the worst-pleased face in the whole room is, I think,
          that of old Rubellius himself yonder, who has just come in,
          without, it is evident, being aware that any feast was going
          forward. Without question, the crafty usurer is of opinion he might
          have been invited. I promise you, I can interpret the glances of
          that gray-headed extortioner; and well I may, for it is not the
          first time I have had an opportunity of studying them. Ay, ay,
          quoth he to himself, she may do as she will with the bonds of
          Leberinus; but she might have remembered, that a codicil can be
          easily tacked to the end of a living man’s
          testament.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But, after all,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“one must admit, that if she married old Leberinus to
          please her father, the widow has some right to choose her second
          husband according to the pattern of her own fancy.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! by all means,”</span> answered he;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“let her please herself; let her make a
          fool of herself now, if she will. She may perhaps learn, some time
          or other, that it is as possible to have too young a husband, as to
          have too old a one.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Come
          now,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sabinus, confess that
          if she had selected some well-made, middle-aged man—some
          respectable man—some man of note and distinction, you would have
          judged less harshly of poor Rubellia.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah! you cunning dog,”</span> said he; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“who would have thought that you had brought so much
          wickedness from that new world of yours? But do you really think
          she will wed Sextus? The boy appears strangely cold. I should not
          wonder, when all is done, if the match were more of the orator’s
          seeking than his own.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I can only
          tell you,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I have
          never heard Licinius mention any thing about it; and, I dare say,
          Sextus would be very sorry to think of losing his liberty for the
          sake of the wealth of Leberinus—ay, or for that of old Rubellius to
          boot.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Young friend,”</span> quoth
          he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you are not quite acquainted with the
          way in which these matters are managed at Rome. If we had you six
          weeks at the other side of the Viminal, we should teach you
          better.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I know not how
          long this sort of talk might have lasted; but Licinius put an end
          to it by joining us, and soon engaged the worthy Centurion, and
          several more of us, with some lively, but unintelligible discussion
          on the merits of some new edict, of which none of us had
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span><a name="Pg064"
          id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ever heard, or were likely
          ever to hear any thing again. We were glad to escape from the
          lawyer into another room, where some Greek slaves were performing a
          sort of comic pantomime, that appeared to give more delight to old
          Rubellius than any other of the spectators. As for Sextus, I saw
          plainly that he was quite weary of the entertainment, and anxious
          to get away; but we were obliged to remain till after Licinius was
          gone, for it was evident that he wished his son to see out the
          last. But no sooner had we heard his chariot drive off, than the
          young man and I took leave of the lady, and withdrew. Sabinus
          lingered a moment behind us, and then joined us in the vestibule,
          from which, his course lying so far in the same direction as ours,
          we all proceeded homewards on foot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had proceeded
          along the street of the Suburra for a considerable space, and were
          already beneath the shade of the great Temple of Isis and Serapis,
          (which stands on the northern side of the Esquiline Hill, nigh over
          against the Amphitheatre of Vespasian,) when, from the opposite
          side of the way, we were hailed by a small party of soldiers, who,
          as it turned out, had been sent from the Prætorian camp in search
          of Sabinus, and one of whom had now recognized his gait and
          stature, notwithstanding the obscurity of the hour. The Centurion
          went aside with the leader of these men for some moments, and then
          informed us that it was very fortunate they had so easily
          recognized him, as the business on which they had been sent was
          such as did not admit of being negligently dealt with. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To-morrow,”</span> said he, pointing to the
          Amphitheatre before us, <span class="tei tei-q">“that glorious
          edifice is to be the scene of one of the grandest shows
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg065"
          id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>exhibited by Trajan since his
          accession to the empire. It is the anniversary of the day on which
          he was adopted by Nerva, and the splendour of the spectacle will be
          in proportion to the gratitude and veneration with which he at all
          times regards the memory of that excellent benefactor. But there
          are some parts of the exhibition that I am afraid old Nerva, could
          he be present to behold them, would not regard with the same
          feelings as his successor.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Surely,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          beneficent Trajan will not stain the expression of his gratitude by
          any thing unworthy of himself, or that could give displeasure to
          Nerva?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> replied the
          Centurion, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is not for me to talk about
          any thing that Trajan chooses to do being unworthy of Trajan; but
          you well know that Nerva would never suffer any of the Christians
          to be molested during his reign, and now here are some of these
          unhappy fanatics, that are to be compelled either to renounce their
          faith in the face of the assembly to-morrow, or to die in the
          arena. It is to inspect the condition of these unfortunates, who, I
          know not for what reason, are confined in a dungeon below the
          ramparts in the vicinity of our camp, and to announce to them the
          final determination of their fate, that I, as Centurion of the
          night, have now been summoned. If you are curious to see the men,
          you are at liberty to go with me, and I shall be obliged to you for
          your company.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My curiosity
          having been excited in regard to the new faith and its adherents, I
          was very desirous to accept of this offer. Nor did Sextus any
          sooner perceive that such was my inclination, than he advised me to
          gratify it, undertaking, at the same time, to satisfy his father,
          in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name=
          "Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>case of any inquiry,
          that I was in a place of safety, and under the protection of
          Sabinus. With him, therefore, and with his Prætorians, I proceeded
          along various streets which led us by the skirts of the Esquiline
          and Viminal Hills, on to the region of the Mounds of Tarquin, over
          against which, as you have heard, the great camp of those bands is
          situated;—if indeed that ought of right to be called by the name of
          a camp, which is itself a city of no slender dimensions, and built
          with great splendour of architecture, spread out beyond the limits
          of Rome, for the accommodation of that proud soldiery. There my
          friend took me into his chamber, and furnished me with a cloak and
          helmet, that I might excite no suspicion by accompanying him on his
          errand. The watch-word of the night also was given me, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silent
          faith</span></span>; and proceeding again, we shortly reached the
          place where the Christians were lying.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Entering the
          guard-room, we found it crowded with spearmen of Sabinus’s band,
          some playing at dice, others carousing jovially, many wrapt up in
          their mantles, and asleep upon the floor; while a few only were
          sitting beneath the porch, with their spears in their hands, and
          leaning upon their bucklers. From one of these, the Centurion,
          having drawn him aside, made inquiry concerning the names and
          condition of the prisoners, and whether as yet they had received
          any intelligence as to the morrow. The soldier, who was a grave
          man, well stricken in years, made answer, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that the men were free-born and of decent estate, and
          that he had not heard of any thing else being laid to their charge,
          excepting that which concerned their religion. Since they have been
          here,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have been
          several times set on watch over them, and twice have I lain with
          one of them in his dungeon; yet have I heard no complaints from any
          of them, for in all things they are patient. One of them only is to
          suffer to-morrow—but for him I am especially concerned, for he was
          known to me of old, having served often with me when I was a
          horseman in the army of Titus, all through the war of Palestine,
          and at the siege of Jerusalem.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Is he also a Roman?”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> answered the spearman, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he is no Roman; but he was of a troop of the allies
          that was joined often to our legion, and I have seen him bear
          himself on the day of battle as well as any Roman. He is by birth a
          Greek of the Syrian coast; but his mother was of the nation of the
          Jews.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And yet, although the son of
          a Jewess, he was with us, say you, at the siege of
          Jerusalem?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Even so,”</span>
          replied the man; <span class="tei tei-q">“and not he only, but many
          others; for the Jews were divided against themselves; and of all
          them that were Christians, not one abode in the city, or gave help
          to defend it. As this man himself said, the oracles of the
          Christians, and their prophets, had of old given warning that the
          city must fall into the hands of Cæsar, by reason of the wickedness
          of that people; therefore, when we set our camp against Jerusalem,
          these all passed out from the city, with their wives and children,
          and dwelt safely in the mountainous country until the fate was
          fulfilled. But some of their young men fought in our camp, and did
          good service, because the place was known to them, and they had
          acquaintance with all the secrets of the Rock. Of these, this man
          was one. He and all his household had departed from the ancient
          religion of the Jews, and were believers in the doctrines of the
          Christians, for which cause he is now to suffer; and of that,
          although I have not spoken to him this evening, I think he has
          already received some intelligence, for certain of his friends
          passed in to him, and they covered their faces as they went in, as
          if weeping.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Are these friends
          still with him?”</span> said Sabinus. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> answered he, <span class="tei tei-q">“for
          I must have seen them had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg
          69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>they come forth again. Without doubt, the two
          women are still with him in his dungeon.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Women?”</span> quoth Sabinus; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and of what condition think you they may be?”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“That I know not,”</span> replied the
          soldier; <span class="tei tei-q">“for, as I have said, they were
          muffled in their mantles. But one of them, at least, is a Roman,
          for I heard her speak to him that is by the door of the
          dungeon.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“How long is it,”</span>
          said the Centurion, <span class="tei tei-q">“since they went in to
          the prisoner?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“More than an
          hour,”</span> replied the soldier, looking at the water-clock that
          stood beneath the porch; <span class="tei tei-q">“and if they be
          Christians, they are not yet about to depart, for they never
          separate without singing together, which is said to be their
          favourite manner of worship.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had scarcely
          uttered these words, when the soldiers that were carousing within
          the guard-room became silent, and we heard the voices of those that
          were in the dungeon singing together in a sweet and lowly manner.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, sir!”</span> said the old soldier,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I thought it would be even so—there is not
          a spearman in the band that would not willingly watch here a whole
          night, could he be sure of hearing that melody. Well do I know that
          soft voice—Hear now, how she sings by herself—and there again, that
          deep strong note—that is the voice of the prisoner.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hush!”</span> quoth the Centurion, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“heard you ever any thing half so divine? Are these
          words Greek or Syrian?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“What the
          words are I know not,”</span> said the soldier; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“but I know the tune well.—I have heard it played many
          a night with hautboy, clarion, and dulcimer, on the high walls of
          Jerusalem, while the city was beleaguered.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is some old Jewish tune then,”</span> said Sabinus;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I knew not those barbarians had had half
          so much art.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why, as for that, sir,”</span> replied the man,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I have been all over Greece and Egypt—to
          say nothing of Italy—and I never heard any music like that music of
          the Jews. When they came down to join the battle, their trumpets
          sounded so gloriously, that we wondered how it was possible for
          them ever to be driven back; and then, when their gates were
          closed, and they sent out to beg their dead, they would play such
          solemn awful notes of lamentation, that the plunderers stood still
          to listen, and their warriors were delivered to them with all their
          mail as they had fallen.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And the
          Christians also,”</span> said Sabinus, <span class="tei tei-q">“had
          the same tunes?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh yes, sir—why,
          for that matter, these very tunes may have been among them, for
          aught we know, since the beginning of their nation. I have stood
          sentinel with this very man, and seen the tears run down his cheeks
          by the star-light, when he heard the music from the city, as the
          Jewish captains were going their rounds upon the
          battlements.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“But this,
          surely,”</span> said the Centurion, <span class="tei tei-q">“is no
          warlike melody.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I know
          not,”</span> quoth the old soldier, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“whether it be or not—but I am sure it sounds not like
          any music of sorrow,—and yet what plaintive tones are in the part
          of that female voice!”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The bass
          sounds triumphantly, in good sooth.”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ay, sir, but that is the old man’s own voice—I am sure
          he will keep a good heart to the end, even though they should be
          singing their farewell to him. Well, the Emperor loses a good
          soldier, the hour Tisias dies. I wish to Jupiter he had not been a
          Christian, or had kept his religion to himself. But as for changing
          now—you might as well think of persuading the Prince himself to be
          a Jew.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That last high strain, however,”</span> quoth Sabinus,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071"
          id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“has
          ended their singing. Let us speak to the women as they come out;
          and if it be so that the man is already aware of what is to be done
          to-morrow, I see not why we should trouble him with entering his
          cell. He has but a few hours to live, and I would not willingly
          disturb him.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“I hear them
          coming,”</span> said the soldier. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then do
          you meet them,”</span> said Sabinus, <span class="tei tei-q">“and
          tell them that the Centurion wishes to speak to them ere they go
          away—we will retire out of hearing of the guard.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With that he and
          I withdrew to the other side of the way, over against the door of
          the prison; and we stood there waiting for the women under a
          fig-tree, close by the city wall. In a few minutes two persons,
          arrayed as the soldier had described, drew near to us; and one of
          them, without uncovering her countenance, said,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Master, we trust we have done no evil in visiting the
          prisoners; had it been so, surely we should not have been permitted
          to enter without question.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These words were
          spoken in a voice tremulous, as if with grief rather than with
          terror; but I could not help starting when I heard them. However, I
          commanded myself, and heard in silence what Sabinus
          replied.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Be not alarmed,”</span> said he;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“there is no offence committed, for no
          orders have been issued to prevent these men from seeing their
          friends. I sent for you, not to find fault with what you have done,
          but only to ask whether this prisoner has already been told that
          the Emperor has announced his resolution concerning him, and that
          he must die to-morrow, in the Amphitheatre of Vespasian, unless he
          renounce his superstition.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“He
          knows all,”</span> answered the same voice; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and is prepared for all.”</span></p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By heavens! Valerius,”</span> whispered Sabinus;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it is no mean person that speaks so—this
          is the accent and the gesture of a Roman lady.”</span> Then raising
          his voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“In that case there is no need
          for my going into the dungeon; and yet, could I hope to say any
          thing that might tend to make him change his purpose, I would most
          gladly do so. The Emperor is as humane as he is just, and unless
          when rebellious obstinacy shuts the gates of mercy, he is the last
          that would consent to the shedding of any blood.—For this Tisias,
          of whose history I have just been hearing something, I am in a
          particular manner interested, and to save him, I wish only I had
          power equal to my inclination. Is there no chance of convincing
          <a name="corr072a" id="corr072a" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
          "tei tei-corr">him?</span>”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“He is
          already convinced.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Could his
          friends do nothing?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<a name=
          "corr072b" id="corr072b" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
          "tei tei-corr">His</span> friends have been with him,”</span> said
          the voice.—This last sentence was spoken so distinctly, that I knew
          I could no longer be mistaken; and I was on the brink of speaking
          out, without thinking of the consequences that might occur, when
          she that had spoken, uttered a faint cry, and dropping on her knees
          before Sabinus, said,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, sir! to us also
          be merciful, and let us go hence ere any one behold
          us!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Go in peace, lady,”</span>
          answered the Centurion, <span class="tei tei-q">“and henceforth be
          prudent as well as kind;”</span> and they went away from us, and
          were soon lost to our sight in the windings of the street.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We stood there
          for some moments in silence, looking towards the place where they
          disappeared. <span class="tei tei-q">“Strange superstition,”</span>
          said Sabinus; <span class="tei tei-q">“what heroism dwells with
          this madness!—you see how little these men regard their lives;—nay,
          even women, and Roman women too—you see how their nature is changed
          by it.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“It is, indeed, a most
          strange spectacle,”</span> said I; <span class="tei tei-q">“but
          what is to be the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg
          73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>end
          of it, if this spirit become diffused widely among the
          people?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“In truth I know
          not,”</span> answered the Centurion; <span class="tei tei-q">“as
          yet we have heard of few who had once embraced this faith,
          renouncing it out of fear for their lives.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And in the days of Nero and Domitian,”</span> said I,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“were not many hundreds of them punished
          even here in the capital?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“You are
          within the mark,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“and not
          a few of those who were sent into exile, because of their
          Christianity, were, as you may have heard, of no ordinary
          condition. Among these there were Flavius Clemens, the Consular,
          and his wife, Domitilla; both of whom I have often seen in my
          youth—both relations to the family of Vespasian—whom,
          notwithstanding, all the splendour of the imperial blood could not
          save from the common fate of their sect. But Nerva suffered all of
          them to live in peace, and recalled such as were in exile,
          excepting only Domitilla, whose fate has been regretted by all men;
          but I suppose it was not at first judged safe to recal her, lest
          any tumult should have been excited in her name, by those that
          regretted (and I am sorry to say these were not a few) the wicked
          license of which they had been deprived by the death of her
          tyrannical kinsman, and the transition of the imperial dignity into
          another line. She also with whom we have been speaking, is, I am
          sure, a Roman lady of condition; and you may judge of her zeal,
          when you see it brings her hither at midnight, to mingle tears and
          prayers with those of an obscure Asiatic. Did you observe, that the
          other female both walked and stood behind her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I observed all this,”</span> answered I. But little
          did Sabinus suspect that I had observed so much more than
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074"
          id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>himself had done. Before
          parting from him, I said I should still be gratified with being
          permitted to see the prisoner; and although he declined entering
          himself, he accordingly gave command that the door of his dungeon
          should be opened for me, requesting me, at the same time, to
          refrain from saying any thing more than was necessary for the
          explaining the apparent purpose of my visit,—the communication,
          namely, of Trajan’s decree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion
          withdrew to his camp; and the same old spearman with whom we had
          conversed at the Porch, carried a torch in his hand, and shewed me
          the way into the dungeon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between the
          first door and the second, which appeared to be almost entirely
          formed of iron, there intervened a few broad steps of mason-work;
          and upon the lowest of these, I stood waiting till he should open
          the inner door. Several keys were applied before he discovered the
          right one; but at last the heavy door swung away from before him so
          speedily, that the air, rushing out of the vault, extinguished the
          torch; insomuch, that we had no light excepting that which streamed
          from an aperture high up in the wall of the dungeon itself; a
          feeble ray of star-light alone—for the moon had, long ere this
          time, been gone down—which, nevertheless, sufficed to shew us to
          the prisoner, although we at first could see nothing of him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Soldiers,”</span> said the old man, in a voice of
          perfect calmness, <span class="tei tei-q">“for what reason are you
          come?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“We come,”</span> said my
          companion, <span class="tei tei-q">“by command of the Centurion, to
          inform you of things which we would willingly not have to
          tell—To-morrow Trajan opens the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Vespasian.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“My comrade,”</span>
          said the prisoner, <span class="tei tei-q">“is it your voice I
          hear? I knew all this already; and you know of old that I fear not
          the face of death.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I know well,
          Tisias, you fear not death; yet why, when there is no need, should
          you cast away life? Think well, I beseech you, and reserve yourself
          for a better day.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“The dawn of that
          better day, Romans, already begins to open upon my eyes. I see the
          east red with the promise of its brightness. Would you have me
          tarry in darkness, when I am invited to walk forth into the
          light?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Your words rejoice
          me,”</span> answered the spearman; <span class="tei tei-q">“and I
          am sure all will rejoice in hearing that you have at length come to
          think thus—Trajan himself will rejoice. You have but to say the
          word, and you are free,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“You mean
          kindly,”</span> said the old man, rising from his pallet, and
          walking towards us as far as his fetters permitted; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“but you are much mistaken—I have but to keep silence,
          and I am free.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Alas! what mean
          you? Do you know what you say? You must worship the gods in the
          morning, else you die.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Evening,
          and morning, and for ever, I must worship the God that made heaven
          and earth. If I bow down to the idols of Trajan, I buy the life of
          a day at the price of death everlasting. Tempt me not in your
          kindness: I fell once. Great God, preserve me from falling! I have
          bade farewell to my friends already. Leave me to spend these few
          hours by myself.—Leave me to prepare the flesh for that from which
          the spirit shrinks not.”</span> So saying, he extended his hand to
          the spearman, and the two old men embraced each other before
          me.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          said the other, <span class="tei tei-q">“and keep watch at the
          door. I am but a poor spearman, and this young patrician can do
          more than I.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Be it so,”</span>
          said the prisoner, a second time embracing him; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I would not willingly expose you to any needless
          danger; and yet I see not what danger there is in all that I have
          to ask.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this the
          spearman withdrew; and being left alone with Tisias, I took his
          hand, and sitting down beside him on his pallet, shortly explained
          to him the circumstances under which I had come thither.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Young sir,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          know not what is about the sound of your voice, and the frankness
          of your demeanour, that makes me feel confidence enough to intrust
          you with a certain thing, which concerns not <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>myself, nor any hope of mine, for that
          were little—but the interests of one that is far dearer to me than
          I can express, and who, I hope, will live many happy days upon
          earth, after I shall have sealed my belief in the message of God,
          by blood that has of old been exposed a thousand times to all
          mortal perils, for the sake of worthless things. But a very short
          while ago, and I might have executed this thing for myself; but
          weakness overcame me at the moment of parting.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          safety.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> he proceeded, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          have here with me certain writings, which I have carried for these
          twenty years continually in my bosom. Among these, is one of the
          sacred books of the faith for which I am to die, and I would fain
          have it placed in the hands of one to whom I know it will be
          dearest of all for the sake of that which it contains; but, I hope,
          dear also for the sake of him that bequeaths it. Will you seek out
          a certain Roman lady, and undertake to give into her own hands, in
          secret, the scroll which I shall give you?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will do my endeavour,”</span> said I; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and if I cannot find means to execute your command, I
          shall destroy the book with my own hands before I quit Rome—for my
          stay here is uncertain.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“If you
          cannot find means to do what I ask safely,”</span> he replied,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I do not bid you destroy the
          book—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">that</span></span> is yours to do with as it
          shall seem good to you—but I conjure you to read it before you

          you seek to give it to her whose name I shall <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mention.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Old man,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“almost I believe that I already know her name, and
          more besides. If it be so that I have conjectured aright, be
          assured that all you ask shall be fulfilled to the letter; be
          assured also, that I would die with you to-morrow, rather than live
          to be the cause or instrument of any evil thing to her that but now
          visited you in your dungeon.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> cried the old man, starting up,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lay not this also, O Lord! upon my head.
          Let the old bear witness—but let the young be spared, to serve thee
          in happier years upon the earth!”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Be not afraid,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“if it was Athanasia, no one suspected it but myself;
          and I have already told you that I would die rather than bring evil
          upon her head.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> he answered, after a pause—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it was, indeed, Athanasia. Who is it but she that
          would have left the halls of nobles, and the couches of peace, to
          breathe at midnight the air of a dungeon, that she might solace the
          last moments of a poor man, and, save the bond of Christ, a
          stranger! But if you have known her before, and spoken with her
          before, then surely she must indeed be safe in your hands. You know
          where she dwells—that I myself know not. Here is the scroll, from
          which that noble maiden has heard my humble voice essay to expound
          the words of eternal life. I charge you to approach her with
          reverence, and give into her own hands my dying bequest; yet, as I
          have said, deliver it not to her till you have yourself read what
          it contains.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Christian,”</span>
          said I, placing the writing in my bosom, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“have no fear—I will read your book, and ere two nights
          have gone over my head, I shall find means to place it in the hands
          of Athanasia; and now, fare<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg

          not yet for the last time. Will you not come in the morning, and
          behold the death of a Christian?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“what
          will it avail that I should witness the shedding of your blood? The
          Prince may have reason to regard you as an offender against the
          state; but I have spoken with you in your solitude, and know that
          your heart is noble. Would to Heaven, that by going thither I could
          avert your fate!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Methinks,
          sir,”</span> he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“it may be
          weakness—but yet methinks it would give me some farther comfort in
          my death, to know that there was at least one Roman there, who
          would not see me die without pity; and besides I must have you
          constrain yourself, that you may be able to carry the tidings of my
          departure. Her prayers will be with me, but not her eyes. You must
          tell Athanasia the manner of my death.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“For that cause,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will constrain myself, and be present in the
          Amphitheatre.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Then,
          farewell,”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“——and yet go
          not. In whatsoever faith you live,—in whatsoever faith you die, the
          blessing of an old man and a Christian can do you no harm.”</span>
          So saying, the old man stood up, and leaning his hand on my head as
          I sat, pronounced over me a blessing which I never shall forget.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord bless thee—the Lord enlighten thy
          darkness—the Lord plant his seed in thy kind heart—the Lord give
          thee also to die the death of a Christian!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had said
          so, he sat down again; and I departed greatly oppressed in spirit,
          yet feeling, I know not how or why, as I would rather have lost
          many merry days, than that dark and sorrowful hour. The soldiers in
          the guard-room were so much engaged in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          me not as, dropping my borrowed habiliments, I stept silently to
          the gate; and I was soon out of sight of their flaming watch-fires,
          and far from the sounds of their noisy mirth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman
          streets were totally silent and deserted. It was the first time
          that I had been in the presence of a human being, foreseeing
          distinctly, and quietly waiting, the termination of his mortal
          existence, and I could not help asking of myself, how, under
          similar circumstances of terror, I should have been able to sustain
          my spirits?—to what resources I should, in such a moment, look for
          the support which seemed to have been vouchsafed so abundantly to
          this old man; by what charm, in fine,—by what tenet of philosophy,
          or by what hope of religion,—I should, in the midst of life, be
          able to reconcile myself to a voluntary embrace of death! To avoid
          disgrace, indeed, and dishonour, said I, I think I could be Roman
          enough to dare the worst; but this poor man is willing to die,
          rather than acknowledge, by one offering on the altar, the deities
          in whose worship all his Greek ancestors have been trained; yet
          who, except perhaps a few obscure individuals that have adopted the
          same new superstition, would think this man dishonoured by
          returning to the religion of his fathers? Deep, indeed, must be his
          conviction of the truth of that which he professes to
          believe—serious indeed must be his faith, and high his trust. What
          if, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name=
          "Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>after all, his faith
          should be true, and his trust wise? And the gentle Athanasia!—She
          too a Christian! Might not this mystery be hereafter explained to
          me by her lips?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Musing and
          meditating thus, it was no wonder that I, who knew so little of
          Rome, should have soon wandered from the straight way to the home
          of my kinsman. But that I at last caught, at the turning of a
          street, a glimpse of the Flavian Amphitheatre, which I had before
          passed on my way from the feast of Rubellia, I might, perhaps, have
          wandered long. I had some notion how that grand edifice was
          situated with respect to the house of Licinius, and therefore moved
          towards it immediately, intending to pass straight down from thence
          into the Sacred Way. But when I came close to the Amphitheatre, I
          found that, surrounded on all sides by a city of sleep and silence,
          that region was already filled with all manner of noise and tumult,
          in consequence of the preparations which had begun to be made for
          the spectacles. The east hardly yet indicated dawn; but the torches
          and lanterns of workmen and artificers were in motion every where.
          On one side, the whole way was blocked up with a throng of waggons;
          the conductors, almost all Ethiopians and Numidians, lashing each
          other’s horses, and exchanging, in their barbarous tongues,
          outcries of wrath and execration. The bellowings that resounded
          from any of the waggons, which happened to be set in motion amidst
          the throng, intimated that savage beasts were confined within them;
          and when I had discovered this, and then regarded the prodigious
          multitude of the vehicles, I cannot say what horror came over me at
          thinking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg
          83]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>what cruel sights, and how lavish in cruelty,
          were become the favourite pastimes of the most refined of nations.
          I recognized the well-known short deep snort of the wild boar, and
          the long hollow bark of the wolf; but a thousand fierce sounds,
          mingled with these, were new to my ears. One voice, however, was so
          grand in its notes of sullen rage, that I could not help asking a
          soldier, who sate on horseback near me, from what monster it
          proceeded. The man answered, that it was a lion; but then what
          laughter arose among some of the rabble, that had overheard my
          interrogation; and what contemptuous looks were thrown upon me by
          the naked negroes, who sate grinning in the torch-light, on the
          tops of their carriages! Then one or two of the soldiers would be
          compelled to ride into the midst of the confusion, to separate some
          of these wretches, fighting with their whips about precedence in
          the approach; and it seemed to me that the horses could not away
          with the strong sickly smell of the wild beasts; for they would
          prance, and caper, and rear on end, and snort as if panic-struck,
          and dart themselves towards the other side; while some of the
          riders were thrown off in the midst of the tumult, and others, with
          fierce and strong bits, compelled the frightened or infuriated
          animals to endure the thing they abhorred—in their wrath and pride
          forcing them even nearer than was necessary. In another quarter,
          this close-mingled pile of carts and horses was surmounted by the
          enormous heads of elephants, thrust up into the air, some of them
          with their huge lithe trunks lashing and beating (for they, too, as
          you have heard, would rather die than snuff in the breath of these
          monsters of the woods,) while the tiara’d <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>heads of their riders would be seen tossed to
          and fro by their contortions. What a cry of cursing, what cracking
          of whips and cords, what blowing of horns, and whistling and
          screaming; and all this mixed with what roaring and howling from
          the savage creatures caged in darkness!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I went, however,
          for a moment, into the Amphitheatre, by a little side-way, where
          admission was cheaply obtained. Here, as yet, all things were in
          order, for the hour had not yet come for giving the wild beasts
          entrance to the huge dens prepared for them. A few carpenters only
          were seen in one corner, erecting a sort of low stage, and singing
          merrily, of whom, when I made inquiry concerning the purpose of
          that erection, one of these fellows also began to jeer;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Whence come you, good sir, that you do not
          know a common scaffold when you see it? It is surely not the first
          time that a Christian has had his head chopped off in the
          Flavian?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“By Pluto, I am not so
          sure about that matter,”</span> quoth another. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I don’t know whether any of the dogs were ever
          beheaded here or not; if they have been, I can only say it was
          better than they deserved.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“There
          spoke a true man,”</span> cries a third. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, no; keep beheading for Romans—let citizens have
          their own. Things are come to a pretty pass, when they shew us
          nothing but tigers against tigers. By Jove, I would rather see one
          of those misbelieving Atheists set right before the mouth of a true
          Getulian lion’s cage, and hear his bones cracked ere all be over,—I
          say, I would rather see that, than fifty of your mere beast
          fights.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“After all,”</span>
          rejoined the first, <span class="tei tei-q">“it must be allowed
          that our Cæsar had a fine eye for the
          Amphitheatre.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg
          85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“Who doubts
          it?”</span> says the other. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rome has never
          seen any thing that deserved to be called a show, since he was
          killed by sneaking traitors. They say, Nero was still better at
          that sort of work; but <span class="tei tei-q">‘let the skinless
          Jew believe,’</span> as the saying is. I desire to see no better
          sport than Domitian gave us the very week before his death. We
          shall never live to see his like again!”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come, boys,”</span> rejoins one of the rest;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“no despairing! I had begun to think that
          these good princes, as they call them, would never shew us a bit of
          real sport again. Here, now, is at least something. Who can tell
          what may follow? and, besides, if the worst come to the worst, we
          shall still have lions against lions, tigers against tigers,
          Dacians against Dacians, and now and then a Jew or a Christian, or
          whatever you please to call him, exhibited <span lang="la" class=

          "font-style: italic">solus</span></span> on such a stage as this.
          Come, come, don’t make matters worse than they are.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ruffians
          shewed that they knew well enough I was displeased, and I half
          regretted, as I strode away from them, the want of that Prætorian
          helmet, which would have preserved me from the insolence of their
          mirth. However, I was well pleased to gain a distance at which I
          could no longer be troubled with them, and walked with rapid steps
          along the wide streets, over which morning was now beginning to
          shine; while the air, agitated with a quick breeze, refreshed my
          cheeks and temples—of which I had need, being heated with the glare
          and noise, and, perhaps, faint, too, after the manner of the young,
          from want of sleep.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was admitted
          into the house by Dromo, who seemed to have been looking out for
          me; for he opened the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg
          86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>door almost before I had time to knock at it.
          He regarded me as I entered with a very cunning face; insomuch,
          that I comprehended without difficulty, he believed me to have
          spent the night in some scene of debauch; but he, nevertheless,
          attended me, without saying a word, into my chamber. He then
          assumed a countenance of great reflection, and advised me, with
          much appearance of friendly concern, to go to bed, even although I
          could not stay long there; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“because,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
          will feel much fresher when you get up; and let me tell you, you
          must be up early, for I have already been with Licinius, who
          intends to send Sextus with a present to Rubellia immediately after
          breakfast; and you may be sure he will insist on your company, for
          he can do nothing without you. Ah! had it not been for a certain
          pretty creature, the young gentleman would not, I am confident,
          have permitted you to be going the rounds in this way by yourself.
          But I take it something amiss, and shall tell him so, that he did
          not depute me (who am not particularly enamoured just at present)
          to go with you, and take care of your safety. I only wonder how you
          have got home so well as it is.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Indeed,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“good
          Dromo, I cannot help wondering a little at that myself—for I have
          been all through the city, and lost my way half-a-dozen times over,
          and yet here you see I am.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
          more reason,”</span> quoth the slave, <span class="tei tei-q">“that
          you should send some little offering to Mercury’s Temple over the
          way, in the morning—a few sesterces will be sufficient—and if you
          have no objections, I shall willingly take care of them for you.
          Mercury is the guardian of all that travel about in the dark; and
          besides, he is the special patron <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>of love expeditions. But to say the truth, you
          are not the only person that owes a gift to that shrine; for the
          worthy sage—Xerophrastes—he, too, has been a night-wanderer—and he
          has not yet come in. I have my doubts whether, when he does so, he
          will be as sober as you are; but I must take care to be at my post,
          and admit him in silence, for the time is not yet come to uncloak
          his doings. Trust me, this is not the only vagary I have set down
          to his account—all in good time. But what says my master Valerius,
          touching the offering to the great God Hermes?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I saw, by the
          knave’s face, that it was necessary the sesterces should be
          forthcoming. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here they are,”</span> said
          I, <span class="tei tei-q">“good Dromo; and remember, that although
          Mercury, among other things, is the god of thieves also, he will
          not be well pleased if you curtail his offering.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Never mind,”</span> answered the varlet,
          as he was shuffling out of the room, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mercury and I understand each other of old. Go to bed,
          and try to get a little of your own old British red into your
          cheeks again; for Licinius has a hawk’s eye, and will be sure to
          have his suspicions, if he sees you come down with such a haggard
          look. Remember you have not a beard to cover half your face, and
          all your iniquities.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So saying, he
          left me to my couch, indeed, but not to slumber; for busy thoughts
          kept me broad awake, till, after the lapse of perhaps an hour,
          young Sextus entered my apartment, already arrayed with more than
          usual elegance, to execute, however unwillingly, the message of his
          father. He had in his hand a small casket of open ivory-work, which
          he flung down on my bed, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Get up,
          dear Valerius, and save me <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg
          88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>at
          least from the pain of going alone with these gewgaws. Would to
          Heaven my father would marry her himself, and then I should have no
          objection to carry as many caskets as he pleases. But do you get up
          and assist me; and as we go along, you shall tell me what you have
          seen and heard in company with your jovial Prætorian.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was soon
          ready, and ascended, along with my young friend, the chariot which
          Licinius had commanded to be ready. I told him, as we glided
          through the streets, as much as I judged expedient; and, in
          particular, when I perceived that our charioteer was making a
          circuit, in order to avoid the neighbourhood of the Amphitheatre, I
          could not help expressing to him the effect which had been produced
          in my mind, by my casual inspection of the preparations.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid, then,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that you will scarcely be willing to
          witness the exhibition itself; and yet I would fain have you to
          overcome your aversion, both because, whatever you may think of
          such things, it is not fitting that you should go from Rome without
          once, at least, seeing how they are conducted; and more
          particularly, because I much suspect Rubellia intends to be present
          at the festival—in which case I should be sorry to be compelled to
          attend upon her without you; and as to leaving her at the gate of
          the Amphitheatre, that, you know, would be quite impossible, unless
          I wished openly to contradict the wishes of my father.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I assured him he
          should not want any comfort my presence could afford him; although
          not without, at the same time, expressing my astonishment that he
          should consider it at all probable that his dainty <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Rubellia would choose to sit among the
          spectators of an exhibition so abounding in circumstances of
          cruelty, and, as I had understood, forbidden to her sex.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> answered he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“laws and edicts are made to be broken in such cases;
          and as for the cruelty of the scene, there is scarcely a lady in
          Rome that would be more scrupulous on that head than my widow. To
          tell you the truth, one of the things that makes me most unwilling
          to go, is the fear that Sempronia also may be there; and, perhaps,
          when she sees me with Rubellia, give credence to some of the
          reports which have been circulated (not without my father’s assent,
          I think, if all were known,) about this odious marriage, which I
          swear to you shall never take place, although Licinius were to
          drive me from his door, and adopt a stranger.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sextus,”</span> I made answer, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“if Sempronia thinks there is any thing serious between
          the widow and you, she must think you a pretty rascal, for the
          violent love you made to herself at the Villa. But I am sure she
          will easily perceive, by your countenance, that you do not regard
          Rubellia, handsome as she is, with any extraordinary admiration;
          whereas—if you were not conscious of it, I am sure she must have
          been so—there was never a face of more passionate love than yours,
          all the time you were in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">her</span></span> company. And, even now, the
          very mention of her name calls a glow into your cheeks,—yes, and
          even into your eyes,—that I think would flatter Rubellia, could she
          excite such another, more than all the jewels of all the caskets
          your father will ever send.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Distract me not, O Valerius!”</span> said the
          youth,—<span class="tei tei-q">“distract me not with speaking of
          that too lovely, and, I fear, too scornful <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>girl. Do you not perceive that we have at last
          struck into the Suburra, and are quite near to Rubellia’s
          house?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“It is so,”</span> said I,
          looking out of the carriage, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I suspect
          you are right in thinking she means to be present at the
          Amphitheatre, for there is a crowd of urchins about her gate, and I
          perceive a brilliant group of equipages has attracted them. She
          purposes to go in all her splendour.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Good Heavens!”</span> replied he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I believe all the world is to be there. I never passed
          so many chariots; and as for the rabble, see what a stream of heads
          continues pouring down out of every alley. My only hope is, that
          Rubellia may arrive too late for the best situations, and perhaps
          disdain to witness the spectacle from any inferior part of the
          Amphitheatre; and yet she must have interest, no doubt, to have
          secured good accommodation beforehand.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We were just in
          time to meet Rubellia stepping from her portico with a gay cluster
          of attendants. On seeing us, however, she beckoned with her finger,
          and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, are you come at last? Well,
          I must take Valerius with myself, for I insist upon it that I shall
          be best able to point out what is worthy of his notice; and you,
          Sextus Licinius, come you also into my chariot; we will not
          separate you from your Orestes.”</span> She said so with an air of
          sprightly ease and indifference, and sprung into the carriage. An
          elderly lady, with a broad merry face, went into it also, but there
          was still room for Sextus and myself; and the rest of the party
          followed in other vehicles that were waiting.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The crowd by
          this time had so accumulated, that our horses could not advance but
          at leisurely pace; but the noise of the multitude as they rushed
          along, and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg
          91]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>tumult of expectation visible on every
          countenance, prevented us from thinking of any thing but the
          festival. The variety, however, and great splendour of the
          equipages, could not but attract my attention. Now it was an open
          chariot, drawn by milk-white Thessalian horses, in which reclined
          some gorgeous female, blazing with jewellery, with a cluster of
          beautiful boys or girls administering odours to her nostril; and
          perhaps some haughty Knight or Senator now and then offering the
          refreshment of his flattery. Then, perhaps, would come rumbling
          along, a close clumsy waggon, of the old-fashioned matronly sort,
          stuck full with some substantial plebeian family—the fat,
          comfortable-looking citizen, and his demure spouse, sitting well
          back on their cushions, and having their knees loaded with an
          exulting progeny of lads and lasses, whose faces would, every now
          and then, be thrust half out of the window, in spite of the
          mother’s tugging at their skirts. And then, again, a cry of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Place, place,”</span> and a group of
          lictors, shoving every body aside with their rods, before the
          litter of some dignified magistrate, who, from pride or gout,
          preferred that species of motion to the jolting of a chariot. Such
          a portly person as this would soon be hurried past us, but not
          before we had time to observe the richness of the silken cushions
          on which he lay extended, or the air of majesty with which he
          submitted himself to the fan of the favoured freedman, whose
          business it was to keep those authoritative cheeks free from the
          contamination of common dust and flies. Anon, a jolly band of young
          gallants, pushing their steeds along, to not a few of whom the fair
          Rubellia would vouchsafe her salutation. <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page92">[pg 92]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>But wherever the carriage was stopped for an
          instant, it was wonderful to see the number of old emaciated men,
          and withered hags, that would make their way close up to the
          windows, imploring wherewithal to obtain a morsel. The widow
          herself leaned back on these occasions, as if to avoid the sight;
          but she pointed to a bag of small coin that hung in a corner of the
          chariot, and from it Sextus distributed to the one side, and I to
          the other; and yet it was impossible to give to every one; we were
          surrounded all the way with a mingled clamour of benedictions from
          those that had received, and execrations from those that had got
          nothing, and noisy ever-renewed solicitations from that
          ever-swelling army of mendicants. At last, however, we arrived in
          safety at the western gate—the same around which I had, the night
          before, witnessed such tumultuous preparation. One of the officers
          in waiting there, no sooner descried the equipage, than he caused a
          space to be laid open for its approach, and himself advanced to
          hand Rubellia into the interior, but she whispered to Sextus and
          me, by no means to separate from her in the crowd.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Behold me,
          therefore, in the midst of the Flavian Amphitheatre, and seated,
          under the wing of the luxurious Rubellia, in a very convenient
          situation. There was a general silence in the place, because
          proclamation had just been made that the gladiators, with whose
          combats the exhibition was to commence, were about to enter upon
          the arena, and shew themselves in order to the people. As yet,
          however, they had not come forth from that place of concealment to
          which so many of their number would never return; so that I had
          leisure to collect my thoughts, and survey for a moment, without
          disturbance, the mighty and most motley multitude, piled above,
          below, and on every side around me, from the lordly senators, on
          their silken couches, along the parapet of the arena, up to the
          impenetrable mass of plebeian heads which skirted the horizon,
          above the topmost wall of the Amphitheatre itself. Such was the
          enormous crowd of human beings, high and low, that when any motion
          went through their assembly, the noise of their rising up or
          sitting down might be likened to the sullen roaring of the sea, or
          the rushing of a great night-wind in a forest. Not less than eighty
          thousand human beings, they told me, were here met together.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg094"
          id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Such a multitude could no
          where be regarded, without inspiring a certain indefinable sense of
          majesty; least of all, when congregated within the wide sweep of
          such a glorious edifice, and surrounded on all sides with every
          circumstance of ornament and splendour, befitting an everlasting
          monument of Roman victory and imperial munificence. Judge, then,
          with what eyes all this was surveyed by me, who had but of
          yesterday emerged from a British valley—who had been accustomed all
          my life to consider as among the most impressive of spectacles, the
          casual passage of a few scores of legionaries through some dark
          alley of a wood, or awe-struck village of barbarians.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Trajan himself
          was already present—his ivory chair distinguished only by its
          canopy from that of the other Consul who sate over against him;
          tall and majestic in his demeanour; grave, sedate, and benign in
          countenance, as you have seen in his medals and statues. He was
          arrayed in a plain gown, and appeared to converse quite familiarly,
          without affectation of condescension, with such Patricians as had
          their places near him; among whom Sextus and Rubellia pointed out
          many remarkable personages to my notice; as Adrian, afterwards
          emperor; Pliny, the orator, a man of courtly presence, and lively,
          agreeable aspect; and, above all, the historian Tacitus, the worthy
          son-in-law of our Agricola, in whose pallid countenance I could
          easily recognize the depth, but sought in vain to discover any
          traces of the sternness of his genius. Of all the then proud names
          that were whispered into my ear, could I recollect or repeat them
          now, how few would awaken any interest in your minds! Those,
          indeed, which I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg
          95]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>have mentioned, have an interest that will
          never die. Would that the greatest and the best of them all were to
          be remembered only for deeds of greatness and goodness!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proclamation
          being repeated a second time, a door on the right hand of the arena
          was laid open, and a single trumpet sounded, as it seemed to me,
          mournfully, while the gladiators marched in with slow steps, each
          man—naked, except being girt with a cloth about his loins—bearing
          on his left arm a small buckler, and having a short straight sword
          suspended by a cord around his neck. They marched, as I have said,
          slowly and steadily; so that the whole assembly had full leisure to
          contemplate the forms of the men; while those skilled in such
          business were fixing, in their own minds, on such as they thought
          most likely to be victorious, and laying wagers concerning their
          chances of success, with as much unconcern as if they had been
          contemplating irrational animals, or rather, indeed, I should say,
          so many pieces of ingenious mechanism. The diversity of complexion
          and feature exhibited among these devoted athletes, afforded at
          once a majestic idea of the extent of the empire, and a terrible
          one of the purposes to which that wide sway had often been made
          subservient. The beautiful Greek, with a countenance of noble
          serenity, and limbs after which the sculptors of his country might
          have modelled their symbols of graceful power, walked side by side
          with the yellow-bearded savage, whose gigantic muscles had been
          nerved in the freezing waves of the Elbe or Ister, or whose thick
          strong hair was congealed and shagged on his brow with the breath
          of Scythian or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg
          96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Scandinavian winters. Many fierce Moors and
          Arabs, and curled Ethiopians, were there, with the beams of the
          southern sun burnt in every various shade of swarthiness upon their
          skins. Nor did our own remote island want her representatives in
          the deadly procession, for I saw among the armed multitude—not
          surely without some feelings of more peculiar interest—two or three
          gaunt barbarians, whose breasts and shoulders bore uncouth marks of
          blue and purple, so vivid in the tints, that I thought many months
          could not have elapsed since they must have been wandering in wild
          freedom along the native ridges of some Silurian or Caledonian
          forest. As they moved around the arena, some of these men were
          saluted by the whole multitude with noisy acclamations, in token, I
          suppose, of the approbation wherewith the feats of some former
          festival had deserved to be remembered. On the appearance of
          others, groans and hisses were heard from some parts of the
          Amphitheatre, mixed with contending cheers and huzzas from others
          of the spectators. But by far the greater part were suffered to
          pass on in silence;—this being in all likelihood the first—who
          could tell whether it might not also be the last day of their
          sharing in that fearful exhibition!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their masters
          paired them shortly, and in succession they began to make proof of
          their fatal skill. At first, Scythian was matched against
          Scythian—Greek against Greek—Ethiopian against Ethiopian—Spaniard
          against Spaniard; and I saw the sand dyed beneath their feet with
          blood streaming from the wounds of kindred hands. But these
          combats, although abundantly bloody and terrible, were regarded
          only as preludes to the serious <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>business of the day, which consisted of duels
          between Europeans on the one side, and Africans on the other;
          wherein it was the well-nigh intransgressible law of the
          Amphitheatre, that at least one out of every pair of combatants
          should die. Instead of shrinking from these more desperate
          brutalities, the almost certainty of their termination seemed only
          to make the assembly gaze on them with a more intense curiosity and
          delight. Methinks I feel as if it were but of yesterday,
          when,—sickened with the protracted terrors of a conflict, that
          seemed as if it were never to have an end, although both the
          combatants were already covered all over with hideous gashes,—I at
          last bowed down my head, and clasped my hands upon my eyes. I had
          scarcely done so, when Rubellia laid her hand upon my elbow,
          whispering, <span class="tei tei-q">“Look, look, now look,”</span>
          in a voice of low, steady impatience. I did look, but not to the
          arena: No; it was upon the beautiful features of that woman’s face
          that I looked, and truly it seemed to me as if they presented a
          spectacle almost as fearful. I saw those rich lips parted, those
          dark eyes extended, those smooth cheeks suffused with a steadfast
          blush, that lovely bosom swelled and glowing; and I hated Rubellia,
          for I knew not before how utterly beauty can be brutalized by the
          throbbings of a cruel heart. But I looked round to escape from the
          sight of her;—and the hundreds of females that I saw fixed with
          equal earnestness on the same horrors, taught me, even at the
          moment, to think with more charity of that pitiless gaze of
          one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At that instant
          all were silent in contemplation of the breathless strife;
          insomuch, that a groan, the first that had escaped from either of
          the combatants, although <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg
          98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>low
          and suppressed, sounded distinctly amidst the deep hush, and being
          constrained to turn once more downwards, I beheld that, at length,
          one of the two had received the sword of his adversary quite
          through his body, and had sunk upon the sand. A beautiful young man
          was he that had received this harm, with fair hair, clustered in
          glossy ringlets upon his neck and brows; but the sickness of his
          wound was already visible on his drooping eye-lids, and his lips
          were pale, as if the blood had rushed from them to the untimely
          outlet. Nevertheless, the Moorish gladiator who had fought with him
          had drawn forth again his weapon, and stood there awaiting in
          silence the decision, whether at once to slay the defenceless
          youth, or to assist in removing him from the arena, if perchance
          the blood might be stopped from flowing, and some hope of recovery
          even yet extended. There arose, on the instant, a loud voice of
          contention; and it seemed to me as if the wounded man regarded the
          multitude with a proud, contemptuous glance, being aware, without
          question, that he had executed all things so as to deserve their
          compassion, but aware, moreover, that even had that been freely
          vouchsafed to him, it was too late. But the cruelty of their faces,
          it may be, and the loudness of their cries, were a sorrow to him,
          and filled his dying breast with loathing. Whether or not the
          haughtiness of his countenance had been observed by them with
          displeasure, I cannot say; but those who had cried out to give him
          a chance of recovery, were speedily silent, and Cæsar looking
          round, and seeing all the thumbs turned downwards, was constrained
          to give the sign, and forthwith the young man, receiving again
          without a struggle the sword of the Moor into his gashed bosom,
          breathed forth <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg
          99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his
          life, and lay stretched out in his blood upon the place of guilt.
          With that a joyous clamour was uplifted by many of those that
          looked upon it, and the victorious Moor, being crowned with an ivy
          garland, was carried in procession around the arena by certain
          young men, who leaped down for that purpose from the midst of the
          assembly. In the meantime, those that had the care of such things,
          dragged away, with a filthy hook, the corpse of him that had been
          slain; and then, raking up the sand over the blood that had fallen
          from him, prepared the place, with indifferent countenances, for
          some other tragedy,—while all around me, the spectators were seen
          rising from their places, and saluting each other; and there was a
          buzz of talking as universal as the silence had been during the
          combat; some speaking of this thrust and that ward, and paying and
          receiving money lost and won; some already discoursing of other
          matters, as if nothing uncommon had been witnessed; while others,
          again, appeared to be entirely occupied with the martial music
          which ever struck up majestically at such pauses, beating time upon
          the benches before them, or joining their voices with the proud
          notes of the trumpets and clarions. Rubellia talked gaily with
          Sextus, inviting him to ridicule me with her, for the strangeness
          of behaviour I had displayed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sun, by
          this, had already mounted high in the heavens, and the glare became
          so intolerable, that men could no longer fight on equal terms;
          which being perceived, Cæsar gave command to look after the wild
          beasts, and, in the meantime, (for I heard his voice distinctly,)
          to give warning to the Flamens that they should have their altar
          set forth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon this,
          Trajan, with those immediately about his person, withdrew; but
          Rubellia told me he had only gone to the Palatine by the
          subterraneous path, for the purpose of taking some refreshment, and
          that there was no doubt he would return in time to witness the rest
          of the spectacle. This example, however, was followed in some sort
          by a great part of the spectators, for some departed altogether
          from the Amphitheatre, while many more were seen moving from place
          to place, crossing from one vomitory to another, and paying their
          respects to different parties of friends, who had occupied places
          at a distance from them during the combats. In the meantime,
          servants of Trajan’s household were observed giving directions in
          the arena to a great number of persons, who afterwards began to
          distribute baskets of dried fish, bread, and other eatables, among
          such as chose to accept of them; while viands of a more costly
          description were introduced among the wealthy, by slaves and
          freedmen of their own. Neither were the bearers of water-jars idle,
          nor the street hawkers of fruit; least of all, those whose traffic
          is in snow,—of whom, I believe, hundreds were scrambling in all
          quarters over the benches, whistling shrilly, as is their method,
          to announce the article in which they dealt.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lady
          Rubellia was not one of those who would ever leave her friends
          destitute of the means of refreshment on such an occasion as this;
          and accordingly two or three of her household were soon with us,
          bearing jars of sweet-meats, baskets of fruit, flasks of wine, with
          other appurtenances of a luxurious collation. We had scarcely begun
          to taste of these things, when our attention was attracted by some
          one striding, with great activity, from one row of benches to
          another behind us, and looking round, I discovered the rosy
          countenance of Sabinus, whose anxiety to join us was, as I
          immediately suspected, the cause of this exertion. An ordinary
          person would have sought some circuitous method of approach, rather
          than attempt the sheer descent from one of the stone parapets which
          rose immediately in our rear; but the brawny limbs of the Centurion
          shrunk not from that adventurous leap, and, in a word, I soon found
          him seated beside us, bowing and smiling to Rubellia with his usual
          mixture of boldness and suavity. He delayed not from participation
          in her delicacies; but lifting a goblet of Falernian, drank down,
          without stopping, till he could see the foundation of its interior
          gold. His fingers also soon became acquainted with the receptacles
          of fruit and confectionary; and I was half-inclined to some
          suspicion, that he might perhaps have remained in his original
          situation, had he not chanced to observe the slaves of Rubellia, as
          they came up the vomitory, with their comely-looking,
          napkin-covered baskets upon their heads. As it was, his arrival was
          acceptable, except perhaps to Rubellia, who I thought looked as if
          she were not overmuch pleased with the interruption his mirthful
          talk occasioned to the conver<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>sation on which she had been endeavouring to
          fix the attention of young Licinius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For that,
          however, another interruption had been already prepared in another
          part of the assembly, from which our Xerophrastes also had taken
          cognizance of our position. There was such a crowd, however,
          immediately below us, that I know not whether the philosopher would
          ever have been able to make his way to the region where we sat, had
          it not been that we heard his voice in disputation, and entreated
          those that opposed his passage, if possible, to make room for him.
          The first glimpse we had of his countenance, shewed us that the
          squeeze had been giving him serious inconvenience, for the drops of
          perspiration stood visible on his bald front. The persons whom he
          was addressing, however, seemed to listen with such unconcern, that
          it was impossible not to feel somewhat displeased with them, for
          treating so disrespectfully one whom his venerable aspect might
          have entitled to more courtesy. In vain did he represent to them,
          (for we heard his strong voice distinctly every now and then,) that
          it was not for the sake of any personal ease or convenience he was
          desirous of penetrating into an upper part. In vain did he
          reiterate <span class="tei tei-q">“My pupil”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“my disciple”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“my young
          scholar, Sextus Licinius”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“the son
          of Caius Licinius”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“the son of the
          great orator Caius Licinius is there.”</span> In vain did he
          enlarge upon the constancy of attention which philosophers owe to
          those who are placed by the hands of parents under their
          superintendence. No sooner, however, did Sextus and I begin to shew
          the interest we took in his situation, than Sabinus raised himself
          up on the bench, and called aloud on those that <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>surrounded the Stoic, with a voice of
          much sternness and authority, to let him pass immediately at their
          peril.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many eyes were
          forthwith turned towards us; and whether it were the dignity and
          haughtiness of the Centurion’s voice and attitude, or that his garb
          alone gave him much weight in the assembly, the resistance was
          relaxed, and Xerophrastes enjoyed an opportunity of almost entirely
          recovering his usual serenity of aspect before he reached us. The
          first thing he did was to accept of a cup which I held out to him,
          and then with much courtesy did he thank us all, but most the
          Centurion, for the part he had taken in working out his deliverance
          from the hands, as he expressed it, of those inhuman and illiterate
          persons; <span class="tei tei-q">“while you,”</span> he continued,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“brave warrior, have shewn that in your
          breast, as in that of Epaminondas—of Alexander—and of your own
          Julius—the reverence of the muses, and of divine philosophy, does
          not disdain to inhabit with the ardour of active patriotism, and
          the spirit-stirring delights of Mars.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As for that,”</span> said Rubellia, with a smile,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“all the world knows that Sabinus is quite
          a philosopher—he was just beginning a very learned harangue when we
          were attracted by your voice in the crowd; and you have the more
          reason to thank him, because he was cut very unseasonably short, in
          consequence of the distress in which we perceived you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Most noble lady!”</span> replied the Stoic,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“you know not how much you have delighted
          me; from the first moment, indeed, that my eyes rested upon the
          countenance of your heroic friend, I suspected that he had
          subjected <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg
          104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>himself to some other discipline besides that
          of camps. I saw the traces of thought, lady—and serious
          contemplation. The mind can never exercise its faculties, without
          conveying some symptoms of those internal operations to the
          external surface of the visage. The soul can never energize
          habitually, without betraying its activity in the delicacy and
          acumen, which the more elegant and susceptible parts of the
          corporeal frame acquire during those elaborate and mysterious
          processes of thought. I saw, therefore, and suspected. But what
          thanks are not due to you, for having so agreeably confirmed me in
          this happy suspicion! Of a surety, the noise and tumult of the camp
          is not so well adapted for the theoretic or contemplative life, as
          perfect leisure and retirement; yet, who shall doubt that the soul
          of great energy can overcome all such disadvantages? Who shall
          think that the spirit of Socrates did not eagerly philosophize
          during the campaign he served?—Who shall say that the Stagyrite
          must have suspended his acute, although imperfect investigations,
          even although he had accompanied his royal pupil across the
          Hellespont, and attended all the motions of his victorious army,
          instead of staying at home to teach the youth of Greece?—Who,
          finally,”</span> said he, casting his courteous eyes full on the
          Prætorian, <span class="tei tei-q">“shall suspect but that this
          generous warrior has been effectually advancing the growth of
          philosophic science, within his own mind at least,—if not composing
          works, in his intervals of leisure, destined hereafter to benefit
          and instruct the world, even although he may have been attending
          the flight of the Eagle from utmost Britain to the desert frontiers
          of the Parthian?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Nobody,

          indeed, who has enjoyed any opportunity of being acquainted with
          the Centurion, can have any doubt on that head.—Sabinus,”</span>
          she continued, turning towards him, <span class="tei tei-q">“what
          treatise are you at present engaged with? Come, now, speak out, and

          "tei tei-q">“Not at all,”</span> quoth the Centurion, interrupting
          her; <span class="tei tei-q">“I am only deep in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">love</span></span>——”</span> Saying so, he
          laid his hand in a very tender fashion upon his breast, and even,
          as I thought, began to throw a little sentiment into his eyes; but
          he had no opportunity of going on with his speech, for Xerophrastes
          had no sooner heard him utter the word <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">love</span></span>,
          than he immediately began to pour out a new rhapsody.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Love!”</span> quoth he; <span class="tei tei-q">“Ha!
          love:—in good sooth, a noble subject, and one concerning which not
          a few laudable treatises have been composed. Yet, without question,
          much remains to be done in this matter; and I should be most proud
          if the illustrious Sabinus would vouchsafe to me a perusal of his
          speculations. Without question,”</span> he continued, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you have commenced with a proper definition and
          division of the subject. You have distinguished betwixt what is

          kindred affections, with which hallucinating writers have too often
          committed the error of confounding it. You have described, in the
          first place, the difference between it and the <span lang="grc"

          to the human race.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Hens, for
          example,”</span> quoth the Centurion, with a face of infinite
          gravity.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Even so—<span class=

          attainments of this your noble friend.—Hens—a most acute
          illustration!—See you now, O Sextus!”</span> he went on,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it is not the characteristic of true
          philosophy to despise those illustrations which are drawn from the
          affairs of ordinary life, and the common surfaces of things. No: it
          is rather her part to shew forth her own intrinsic excellence and
          splendour, by raising that which is in itself low and customary, to
          unexpected dignity, by her methods of felicitous application. See
          you, now, with what unexampled skill this hero—this philosopher, I
          should rather say—may I presume to add, this brother
          philosopher?—has illustrated the nature of love in this treatise of
          his, by introducing the domestic habits of your common household
          fowl. Such things should not pass unheeded by the young aspirants
          to learning, because these, more than any other circumstances, may
          furnish them with encouragement to proceed in their course, by
          shewing how many of the materials of philosophy lie every where
          under the eyes of the most common traveller of the path of life;
          and how assuredly it is the fault of the individual himself, if he
          neglect the means of spiritual advancement, which are sure to be
          afforded in whatever situation may chance to have been assigned to
          him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I beg your pardon for interrupting you,”</span> said
          Ru<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name=
          "Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bellia; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“but Sabinus has almost finished the grapes while you
          have been speaking; and I would only just beg to suggest, that it
          is the fault of the individual, Xerophrastes, if he neglects the
          means of corporeal refreshment, which may yet be afforded to him by
          what remains in the basket.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Most kind lady,”</span> resumed he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“your benevolence is worthy of your nobility.—But you
          know not how much the philosophy I have embraced, tends to lessen
          the natural desire of man for such things as you allude
          to—nevertheless,”</span> he continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          will not refuse to partake yet farther of your bounty; for I have
          been sorely dealt with in the multitude, as yourselves
          witnessed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So saying, he
          took hold of the basket, and began to feel in the bottom of it, but
          found very little to his purpose; for, to say the truth, the rest
          of the party had been almost as eager in their attentions to it as
          the Centurion. A few slender bunches, notwithstanding, were still
          there, one of which the philosopher thrust into his mouth, and the
          rest he concealed beneath one of the folds of his huge mantle,
          until he should have made an end of his criticism. Meantime, the
          natural language of the broad, jovial, unreflective countenance of
          our worthy Centurion, seemed considerably at variance from the
          notion of his attainments and pursuits, which this merry lady had
          been instilling into the pedagogue. Rubellia herself, however,
          appeared to enjoy the thing far more keenly than either Sextus or
          I; insomuch, that I was afraid Xerophrastes would penetrate through
          the joke she was playing off upon him, before he had given himself
          his full swing in commen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg
          108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>dation of the Prætorian. But Sabinus, on his
          side, was, as it seemed, of opinion, that he had already heard
          enough of such disquisitions; for he had scarcely seen out the last
          cup of Falernian, ere he began to give hints that he wished very
          much to descend into the arena, for the purpose of observing the
          animals about to be exhibited, while they were yet in their cages.
          Xerophrastes, however, even when he had heard him signify this
          desire, appeared still to be resolved on considering him as one of
          the philosophic order of mankind; for he at once offered to
          accompany him, saying, that the visit was of course intended for
          the gratification of some scientific curiosity, and that therefore
          he should think himself culpable did he neglect the
          opportunity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come, then,”</span> quoth the good-natured Sabinus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“by all means prepare yourself for the
          descent; but at least allow me to precede you, that there may be no
          risk of untimely obstructions.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Most assuredly, noble Centurion,”</span> replied
          Xerophrastes, <span class="tei tei-q">“in this, as in all things, I
          shall be proud to be enumerated among your followers. My pupil,
          also,”</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“and his friend,
          will no doubt accompany us, that they may benefit by our discourse
          on whatever may be subjected to observation.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Venerated friend,”</span> said Rubellia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“would you leave the ladies by themselves in the midst
          of the Amphitheatre? I hope Sextus Licinius, at least, will
          consider our weakness, and remain for our protection.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She laid her
          hand on my companion’s arm, with a look which was decisive. Her
          ancient crony whispered something about the impropriety of leaving
          only one of the party to attend upon two females; but I took
          advan<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name=
          "Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tage of her low tone
          to pretend ignorance of that hint, and rose with the Centurion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Go quickly,”</span> said Sextus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“for the interval must be well-nigh at an end; and if
          those that have gone out begin to rush in again, you may have
          difficulty in regaining your places.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Give fear to the winds,”</span> quoth Sabinus;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“am not I with them, that know every
          lion-feeder in Rome? No chance of the exhibition recommencing
          without my having sufficient warning. It is not for nothing that I
          have lost and won so many thousand sesterces in the Amphitheatre.
          Would to Hercules as much respect were paid to experience every
          where else, as in the Arena to your true old Better. Already, I
          perceive that half a dozen of those knowing characters down below,
          about the entrances to the dens, have detected me. They must fancy
          my purse is in a poor state indeed, when I don’t seem to think it
          worth while to take even a single peep at the cages. Come, worthy
          brother in philosophy, and you, my fellow-voyager, let us be alert,
          lest we arrive after Platæa.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We obeyed with
          due alacrity, and, leaving the reluctant Sextus to his fate,
          touched presently the margin of the arena. We had no sooner arrived
          there, than an old skin-dried limping Numidian, with a bit of
          lion’s hide fastened round his loins—one who, from his leanness and
          blackness, had very much the appearance of having been baked to a
          cinder, drew to the Centurion, with many nods and significant grins
          of recognition. Sabinus, on his part, seemed noways backward to
          acknowledge this acquaintance; but, on the contrary, began to talk
          volubly with him in a strange sort of broken dialect, chiefly
          composed, as I afterwards learned, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>of Punic vocables. After this had lasted some
          minutes, he took Xerophrastes and me by the hand, and seemed to
          introduce us to the Numidian, who then desired us all to come down,
          and he would conduct us to a place where we should see something
          not unworthy of being seen. About to follow these directions, I
          felt my gown seized from behind, and looking round, observed that
          it was my faithful Briton, who, from the heat and confusion of his
          aspect, appeared not to have come thither without a considerable
          struggle. Sabinus seeing him, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! my
          old friend Boto, how have you come to this part of the
          Amphitheatre? We must not leave you behind us, however: Of a
          surety, you have never seen a lion—you shall descend along with
          your master; and who knows but we may persuade Xerophrastes that
          you also are a brother philosopher?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Most noble Centurion,”</span> replied the grateful
          slave, <span class="tei tei-q">“I saw you and my master from the
          very topmost bench, where I have been sitting for these three hours
          with Dromo, and I was determined to draw near to you, if it were
          possible. To go from this place up to yonder quarter would perhaps
          be impossible; but it is never a very difficult matter to go down
          in this world; so, saving your reverence, I trundled myself over
          the benches, and when heads were in my way, I trundled myself over
          them too.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“It is well, good
          Briton,”</span> quoth the Centurion—by this time we had crossed the
          arena—<span class="tei tei-q">“and now prepare to exercise your
          eyes as well as you already have exercised your limbs; for know,
          that very near to you is the abode of nobler animals than even your
          lord hath ever observed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this the
          African opened one of the iron doors <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>edging the arena, and having received some
          money, admitted us to the sight of a long flight of marble steps,
          which appeared to descend into the bowels of the earth, far below
          the foundation of the Amphitheatre. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come
          along, masters,”</span> quoth he; <span class="tei tei-q">“we had
          better go down this way, for we shall have a better view of the
          animals so, than on the other side. My master, Sabinus, will tell
          you all, that old Aspar knows as much about these things as any
          Numidian in the place.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed,
          since friend Bisbal is gone,”</span> quoth the Centurion,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“there is not another of these that is to
          be compared to you.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!”</span>
          replied Aspar, <span class="tei tei-q">“Bisbal was a great man;
          there is not a feeder in Rome that is worthy to tie the latchet of
          his sandals, if he were alive.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why, as to that,”</span> said the other, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“old Bisbal was very seldom worth a pair of sandals
          worth the tying, when he was alive; but, come on, we have no great
          leisure for talking now, and Aspar shall shew a lion with any
          Bisbal that ever wielded whip.—Come on.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We soon reached
          a large vaulted place, apparently below the Amphitheatre, the sides
          of which were almost entirely covered with iron-gratings,—while up
          and down the open space were strolling many strange groupes of men,
          connected in different capacities with the bloody spectacles of the
          arena. On one hand, we saw some of the gladiators, who had already
          been combating, walking to and fro with restless and agitated
          steps, as if they had not yet been able to recover themselves from
          the excitement into which their combats had thrown them. Even of
          such as had been victorious, I observed that not a few partook in
          all these symptoms of uneasiness; and the contrast thus exhibited
          to the haughty mien of calmness they had so lately been displaying,
          af<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name=
          "Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fected me with a
          strange sense of the irrational and inhuman life these unhappy
          persons were condemned by folly or necessity to lead. The blood had
          forsaken the lips and cheeks of others, and from the fixed stare of
          their eyes, it appeared that their minds were entirely withdrawn
          from every thing passing around them. Their limbs, so recently
          nerved to the utmost show of vigour, were now relaxed and unstrung,
          and they trod the marble floor with heavy and straggling feet. But
          they that appeared to me to be in the most wretched state, were
          such as, they told us, expected to be led forth shortly to contend
          with the wild beasts, in whose immediate vicinity they were now
          walking. The summons to battle with a human opponent calls into
          action the fierceness and the pride of man; but he that has to
          fight with a beast, how should he not be weighed down with the
          sense of mortal degradation; how should the Reason that is in him
          not fill him, in such a prospect, with dispiriting and humbling,
          rather than with strengthening and stimulating thoughts? Howbeit,
          the Centurion, although the most good-natured of mankind, being
          rendered from custom quite callous to these things, immediately
          entered into conversation with some of those unfortunates, in a
          tone of coolness and unconcern that shocked me the more, because it
          did not seem in the smallest degree to shock them. Among other
          topics, he enlarged at much length to one of them upon the best
          method of evading the attack of a tiger.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Look ye now,”</span> said he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there are some that are always for taking things, as
          they call it, in good time,—these will be pointing their swords
          before the creature makes his spring; but I have seen what comes of
          that, and so has old Aspar here, if he would be honest <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>enough to confess it. The true way is to
          watch his eye when he is setting; let him fairly fix upon his mark,
          and spring; but at the moment when he is taking his leap, then is
          the time for the gladiator to start aside, and have at him with a
          side-thrust. Your side-thrust is the only one I would lay an
          <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">as</span></span> upon.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yea,”</span> quoth the grinning Aspar,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it was always on your cool steady side-thrust, the
          moment he had sprung, that the great Bisbal used to stake himself.
          Ha! ha! I was fond of the side-thrust in my day myself; but I got a
          scratch once—witness my poor leg, masters,—and since then I am a
          poor feeder.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I was always clear
          for the side-thrust,”</span> quoth Sabinus. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I never saw it fail but twice, and then, to be sure,
          the men died; but they could have had no chance at all with the
          frontguard; and it is always something,”</span> continued he,
          clapping one of the poor expecting gladiators on the
          back,—<span class="tei tei-q">“it is always something to have a
          chance. Be sure you try him with the side-thrust, if it come to
          your turn to-day.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The poor
          creature—he also was an African—lifted up his head on being so
          addressed, and shewed all his white teeth in a melancholy attempt
          at a smile; but said not a word in reply, and forthwith became as
          downcast as before. But the Centurion took little or no heed of the
          manner in which his advice had been received. He contemplated the
          man’s figure for a moment, as if to form some judgment concerning
          the measure of his strength; and after doing the like in regard to
          some of his companions, commanded Aspar to shew us where the prime
          lions of the day were reposing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Numidian
          seized a long pole that was leaning <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>against one of the pillars of the vault, and
          led us to a certain part of the grated wall, behind which was the
          den, wherein six monstrous Atlantic lions were kept. I looked in
          upon them with wonder, and not without dread, through the iron
          net-work of the doors. An imperfect gleam of light descended from
          above upon their tawny hides and glaring eyes. They, like the
          gladiators, seemed also to be preparing for the combat; but not
          like them in fear, nor in cold dewy tremors; for the deprivation of
          food, which they had been made to suffer in prospect of the
          exhibition, had roused all the energies of their savage natures;
          insomuch, that a sulky and yearning rage seemed to spread through
          every nerve and sinew of their gigantic frames, and to make them
          paw their quadrangular prison with long and pliant strides. They
          moved, however, as yet in total silence; so that Boto having fixed
          his eyes upon them, took courage to approach the grate,—slowly,
          nevertheless, and with a face that appeared to lengthen an inch for
          every inch he advanced. But when he had almost touched the bars,
          one of the huge lions came forward towards him, with something
          between a growl and a sigh, which made Boto spring backward with
          great and surprising agility, and with such force, that both he and
          Xerophrastes, who happened unfortunately to have been standing a
          little way behind him, were overthrown at all their length upon the
          floor.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion,
          and the limping old keeper, burst into laughter; but Xerophrastes
          rising, and shaking his garment, said, with some warmth,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Think not, O Sabinus, that any sudden
          start of fear has thus ridiculously stretched me upon the floor;
          but attribute the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg
          115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>mischance only to this rude offspring of
          British earth, whose unreclaimed natural feelings are still
          shamefully affected by natural causes.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Castor and Pollux,”</span> quoth the
          Centurion,—<span class="tei tei-q">“you take every thing too
          seriously, my friend.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I take it
          not seriously,”</span> replied he, with admirable gravity.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“My philosophy forbids me to do so; it has
          steeled me against externals.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Has
          it so, in faith!”</span> rejoined the Centurion. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I think some of your equanimity is, in fact, owing to
          the trifling circumstance, that you have in reality received no
          injury whatever from your tumble. And as to steeling, let me tell
          you, I think the iron in the grated door there is much better
          placed, than in the bosom of a philosopher; for, in the door, it
          serves the purpose of preventing all harm; but if these animals
          were once out, all the mental steel of which you boast would not
          save every bone in your body from being cracked in the twanging of
          a bow-string.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“You speak,”</span>
          replied Xerophrastes, <span class="tei tei-q">“as if you had
          embraced the tenets of a sect not worthy of the lovers of
          wisdom—You speak as if the artificial contrivances of human workmen
          were all in all. An iron cage may confine wild beasts; but can
          cages be made for all those misfortunes to which mankind are
          liable, and against which the force of the mind is their only means
          of defence? Can you cage the Eumenides, when they come to avenge a
          life spent in ignoble indolence and degrading
          luxury?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“In truth,”</span> replied
          the Centurion with a smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have never
          seen the Eumenides except once, and that was in the theatre of
          Athens. But Boto, perhaps, has been more fortunate. Did you ever
          see the Eumenides, good Boto?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“No,
          master,”</span> replied, stupidly, the perplexed Boto, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I never was at the theatre.”</span></p><span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ye gods!”</span> exclaimed the Stoic, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“of a surety this Britain must have been the last spot
          rescued from the dominion of Chaos!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while we
          were yet contemplating those enormous animals, and amused with the
          awkward gestures of Boto, the trumpets were blown in the
          Amphitheatre, and no sooner did the sound of them penetrate into
          the vaults, than it was evident, from the bustle which ensued, that
          the Emperor had returned to his place. With all speed, therefore,
          did we reascend to the upper air, leaving the gladiators in the act
          of mustering in their respective quarters of the gloomy vault; and
          the feeders not less busied in preparing their beasts for the
          expected combat. Had we not been under the protection of Sabinus,
          we should have attempted in vain to regain our places; but he being
          an acknowledged and current authority, known in every department of
          the Amphitheatre, the door-keepers, and other functionaries, durst
          refuse him nothing; room was made for us where no room appeared;
          and, in a word, we shortly found ourselves once more seated by the
          side of Rubellia and Sextus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The day was by
          this time considerably advanced; and, in spite of the awnings
          spread all over head, the rays of the sun were so powerful, that
          the marble benches felt hot to the touch, wherever they were
          exposed to them; and altogether there was such a glare and fervour
          throughout the place, that my eyes began to be weary of gazing; and
          very gladly would I have retired, rather than remain to see out the
          rest of the exhibition. Nevertheless, there was no appearance of
          any one having gone away in weariness; but, on the contrary, the
          seats, and even the passages, seemed to be more crowded than they
          had been in the anterior part of the morning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The arena was
          vacant, when I looked down upon it; but in a short time, a single
          old man, who, as Rubellia told me, had, without doubt, been found
          guilty of some atrocious wickedness, was led forth from a small
          wicket on the one side, and presently his fetters being struck off,
          those that conducted him retired, leaving him alone upon the sand.
          The eyes of this malefactor refused at first to look steadfastly on
          the objects around him, and it seemed to me that he had probably
          been long confined in some dark place, so grievously did the
          dazzling splendour, reflected from the floor and walls,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name=
          "Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>appear to bewilder
          and confound him. Nevertheless, after a brief space, he seemed in
          some measure to recover himself, and assumed a posture of
          resignation, leaning with one hand against the parapet, as if he
          needed support to uphold himself. Pallid and extenuated were the
          outlines of the old man’s visage, and his hair and beard exhibited
          not a little of the squalidness attendant on long confinement; yet
          there was something in the attitude, and even in the countenance,
          which made me harbour the suspicion that he had not, at some former
          period, been altogether unacquainted with the luxuries and
          refinements of social life. The beauty, indeed, of the mould in
          which his form had originally been cast, might, perhaps, have been
          the sole cause of these casual demonstrations of elegance; yet it
          was impossible not to regard the man with greater interest, by
          reason of the contrast suggested between what he once perhaps had
          been, and what he now was.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A feeling of the
          same sort seemed to pervade many more in the assembly; and I heard
          a continual whispering among those around me, as if there was a
          general anxiety to learn something of the history of the man. No
          one, however, appearing to be able to say any thing concerning
          this, I kept my eyes fixed upon himself, awaiting the issue in
          silence. Judge then, what was my surprise, when one of the heralds
          of Trajan, having commanded that there should be silence in the
          amphitheatre, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let Tisias of Antioch
          come forth, and answer to the things that shall be alleged against
          him.”</span> To which the old man, that was alone in the arena,
          immediately made reply,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Here am I—my name
          is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name=
          "Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Tisias of
          Antioch.”</span>—In vain, however, even after hearing the
          well-remembered voice, did I attempt to persuade myself that the
          face was such as I had pictured within myself; for, as to seeing
          it, I have already told you that utter darkness prevailed in the
          dungeon all the time I was there with him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then arose the
          Prefect of the city, who had his place immediately under the chair
          of Cæsar, and said in a voice, which, although not loud, was heard
          distinctly all through the Amphitheatre,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tisias of Antioch, being accused of blasphemy and
          contempt for the Gods, has been brought hither, either to refute
          this charge, by doing homage at the altar of Jupiter Best and
          Greatest; or, persisting in his rebellion, to suffer openly the
          punishment which the laws have affixed to such perversity. Let him
          remain where he is until the Flamens invite all to join in the
          sacrifice.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tisias, hearing
          these words, stept forth into the middle of the arena, and folding
          his arms upon his breast, stood there composedly, without once
          lifting up his eyes, either to the place from which the Prefect had
          spoken, or to any other region of the Amphitheatre. The situation
          in which he stood was such, that I commanded, where I sate, a full
          and distinct view of every movement of the old man’s countenance,
          and assuredly my eyes were in no danger of being directed away from
          him. For a few moments there was perfect silence throughout the
          assembly, until at length the same herald made proclamation for the
          doors to be thrown open, that the priests of Jupiter might have
          access. There was heard forthwith a noise, as of the turning of
          some heavy machinery, and a part of the ground-work <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the arena itself appeared to be
          giving way, right over against that quarter in which Tisias had his
          station. But of this the purpose was soon manifested, when there
          arose from underneath into the space thus vacated, a wooden stage,
          or platform, covered all over with rich carpetings, whereof the
          centre was occupied by a marble altar, set forth already with all
          the usual appurtenances of sacrifice, and surmounted on one side by
          a gigantic statue of bronze, in which it was easy to recognize the
          features of the great Phidian Jupiter. Neither had the altar any
          sooner made its appearance there, and the sound of the machinery,
          by which its great weight had been lifted, ceased to be heard, than
          even as the herald had given command, the main gates of the
          Amphitheatre were expanded, and thereby a free passage prepared for
          the procession of the Flamens. With that, all those that were
          present in the Amphitheatre, arose from their seats and stood up,
          and a sweet symphony of lutes and clarions ushered in the sacred
          band to the place appointed for them. And, first of all, there
          marched a train of fifty beautiful boys, and then an equal number
          of very young maidens, all, both boys and maidens, arrayed in white
          tunics, and having their heads crowned with oaken garlands, and
          bearing in their hands fresh branches of the oak tree, which, above
          all the other trees of the forest, is, as you have heard and well
          know, held dear and sacred to Jupiter. Then these youthful bands
          were separated, and they arranged themselves, the boys on the
          right, and the girls on the left hand of the altar, some of them
          standing on the arena itself, and others on either side, upon the
          steps of the platform whereon the altar was fixed; and
          beauti<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name=
          "Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ful, indeed, was
          their array, and comely and guiltless were their looks; and much
          modesty was apparent, both in the downcast eyes and closed lips,
          with which some of them stood there to await the issue of their
          coming, and in the juvenile admiration wherewith others of them
          were regarding the wide and splendid assemblage around them;
          insomuch, that I could not but feel within myself a certain dread
          and fearfulness, when I saw the feet of so many tender and innocent
          ones placed there upon the same hot and guilty sand, which had so
          often drunk the blood of fierce beasts and cruel
          malefactors—alas!—which had drunk the blood of the innocent
          also—and which was yet to drink thereof abundantly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And after them
          there came in the priests themselves of Jupiter, arrayed in the
          white garments of sacrifice, walking two by two, the oldest and
          principal of them coming last. And behind them again, were certain
          younger assistants, clothed also in white, who led by a cord of
          silk inwrought with threads of silver, a milk-white steer, without
          spot or blemish, whose horns were already gilt, and his broad brows
          crowned with oak leaves and roses. And last of all entered the
          Vestal Virgins, none of whom had ever before been seen by me, and
          they also walked two by two; and no one could contemplate without
          veneration the majesty of their demeanour. With broad fillets were
          they bound around the forehead, and deep flowing veils hung down to
          their feet, entirely covering their faces and their hands;
          nevertheless, their dignity was apparent; and it was not the less
          impressive, by reason of the great mystery in which all things
          about them appeared to be enveloped.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Imagine,
          therefore, to yourselves, how magnificent was the appearance of all
          things, when youths and damsels, and priests and vestals, had taken
          their places, according to the custom of their sacred observances;
          and all that innumerable company of spectators yet standing up in
          the amphitheatre, the choral-hymn was begun, in which every voice
          there was united, except only that of Tisias the Christian. Now, it
          was the soft low voices of the young maidens that sounded, and then
          these would pause, and give place to the clearer and more piercing
          notes of the boys that stood on the other side of the altar; then
          again the priestesses of Vesta would break in from afar with their
          equable harmony; and anon these in their turn ceasing, the Flamens
          of Jupiter would lift up their strong deep chanting, until, at the
          appointed signal from him that stood on the highest step of the
          altar, with the cup of libation in his hand, the whole people that
          were present burst in and joined in the rushing stream of the
          burden, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jupiter,—Jupiter, hear us!—hear
          us, Father of Gods and men!”</span> while the wine was poured out,
          gushing red upon the marble, and the incense flung on high from
          fifty censers, rolled its waves of smoke all over the surface of
          the arena, and quite up to the gorgeous canopy of that resounding
          Amphitheatre. Magnificent, indeed, was the spectacle, and majestic
          the music; yet in the midst of it, how could I take away my eyes
          from the pale and solitary old man, by reason of whose presence
          alone all these things were so? With calm eyes did he regard all
          the pageantry of those imperial rites,—with closed lips did he
          stand amidst all the shouting multitudes. He bowed not his head; he
          lifted not up his hand; neither would he bend his knee, when the
          victim <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
          123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>was slain before the horns of the altar;
          neither would he in any thing give semblance of being a partaker in
          the worship.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the
          song ceased, and there was a proclamation again for deep silence;
          and the Prefect of the city, addressing himself once more to
          Tisias, spoke thus:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Impious and unhappy
          man, with great clemency have all things been conducted as
          concerning thee. When, after long imprisonment, and innumerable
          exhortations in private and in public, thou hadst always rejected
          every means of safety, and spurned from thee the pardon of those in
          whose hands thy being is placed, yet, notwithstanding of all thine
          obstinacy and continual rebellion, was it determined, that, in the
          face of all the people, thou shouldst once more have free grace
          offered to thee, provided only thou shouldst, when all the assembly
          worshipped, join thy voice with them, and bow thy head also toward
          the altar of Jupiter. Nevertheless all that now hear me shall bear
          witness, that, with open and visible contumacy, thou hast rejected
          this opportunity also of being reconciled unto the prince and the
          empire,—that, when every knee bent, and every voice was lifted up,
          thou alone hast stood upright, and thy lips alone have been closed.
          If it be so, that, from some inflicted, rather than voluntary
          perversion of mind, thou hast never yet been able to understand the
          danger in which thou art placed, know now, that there remains no
          hope at all for thee, except for a moment; and let the strong fear
          of death open thine eyes, that thou mayst see where thou art, and
          for what purpose thou hast been brought hither. Thou art a born
          subject of Rome, and thy life can only be held by thee,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name=
          "Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in virtue of
          obedience to the laws. These are clearer upon nothing, than the
          necessity that all men should acknowledge the deities of Rome; and
          of good reason, since, if they be despised, and their authority set
          at nought, by what means shall an oath be ratified, or a pledge
          given; or how may the head, which counsels and protects, be assured
          that the members shall not be lifted up against it? Let silence
          remain in the assembly, and let Tisias of Antioch make his
          election, whether he will give obedience, or suffer the penalty of
          transgression.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
          Prefect, and all those round about Trajan, sat down, and there was
          a deep silence throughout the lower region, where, for the most
          part, they of condition were placed; but when the rabble, that sat
          above, beheld the stern and resolute countenance with which the old
          man stood there upon the arena, it seemed as if they were enraged
          beyond measure, and there arose among them a fierce uproar, and a
          shouting of hatred; and, amidst groans and hisses, there was a cry
          from innumerable voices of—<span class="tei tei-q">“Christian!
          Christian!—Blasphemer! Blasphemer!—Atheist! Atheist!—A tiger! A
          tiger!—Let loose a tiger upon the Christian!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
          the old man preserved unmoved the steadfastness of his demeanour,
          and lifting up his eyes to the place from whence the tumult
          proceeded, regarded the ferocious multitude with a visage, not of
          anger or of scornfulness, but rather of pity and calmness;
          insomuch, that I perceived the nobles and senators were somewhat
          ashamed of the outcry, and the Prefect of the city arose from his
          place, and beckoned with his hand, until the people were weary of
          shouting, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg
          125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>order was, in some measure, re-established in
          the Amphitheatre.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Tisias,
          perceiving that silence once more prevailed, lifted up his hand,
          and bowed himself before Trajan, and the great men of authority
          that were near to his chair, and said, with a firm clear voice, in
          the Roman tongue, <span class="tei tei-q">“My name, O Trajan, is
          Tisias—the son of Androboulos. I am a native of Antioch, in Syria,
          and have in all things, except only in what pertains to this cause,
          observed throughout all the years of my life the statutes of the
          empire, as they, by whose accusation I have been led hither, shall
          themselves be constrained to bear witness for me this day. My
          father was a Greek of Macedonian extraction, being descended from
          one of those that came into Syria beneath the banners of the great
          King Seleucus; but he took to wife a maiden of the Hebrew nation,
          and in process of time became a proselyte to the faith of her
          fathers. Nevertheless, he lived in trust and honour beneath the
          governors appointed by those that were before you in the empire,
          and brought up me and all his children to reverence, in all things
          that are lawful, the authority of Cæsar. But as to the faith of the
          true God, whose worshippers ye blindly and foolishly call atheists
          and blasphemers, from that he neither swerved himself, nor would
          permit any of those that were in his household to depart. Now, when
          he had been a dweller for some time in Jerusalem, the great city of
          the Jews, he began to examine into those things which were reported
          publicly concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who is also called the
          Christ, of which things not a few that had been eye-witnesses were
          then living in that city. And when <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>he had been satisfied from their testimony,
          that those miracles, of which you have all heard, were in truth
          performed in the sight of the people by Jesus, and had listened
          unto the words of their teachers, and saw how they proved that the
          old prophets of the Hebrews had foretold those wonderful works, he
          perceived that Jesus of Nazareth was indeed the Christ of God, and
          the great Deliverer that had been promised to that people, even
          from the beginning of their nation. And he believed on him with all
          his household; and I also, from a stripling, have, although
          unworthy, been a Christian; for by that name were they first called
          in Antioch, the city of my birth.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But being brought into trouble by reason of his
          religion, which the rulers of the Jews abhorred, my father
          departed, after a time, from Jerusalem, and dwelt with my mother in
          one of the villages of Palestine, until his death. Not long after
          which time, the Jews rebelled against Cæsar, and the great war
          began, which terminated in the overthrow of Jerusalem, and the
          utter ruin of their nation. Now, when Vespasian first came with his
          army into those regions, I, being without employment in the place
          where we had our habitation, and having, moreover, taken up a
          great, and perhaps a sinful, wrath against the Jews, on account of
          the sufferings which my father had undergone among them, and of the
          evils which, at their hands, our whole household had sustained,
          joined myself to one of the bands of Syrian auxiliaries; and
          although my mother entreated me, could not be persuaded to refrain
          from following the camp of Cæsar with them. Of which thing it has
          often since then repented me, and in which, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it may be, I still hold myself not to
          have done altogether as was right; for if the Jews had offended
          Cæsar, it was, indeed, a reasonable thing that Cæsar should visit
          them with his vengeance; but, peradventure, it behoved not any of
          them that were descended from the fathers of that people, to take
          part in the warfare. Nevertheless, being then young, and, as I have
          said, irritated by the sense of domestic injuries, I scrupled not
          to fulfil in all things the duty of a soldier, and followed the
          eagles of Vespasian and his son, even to the day when the lines
          were drawn around the Holy City; and it was manifest, that the war
          could have no end, but in the eternal overthrow of the power of the
          Jews. Neither did the length of the siege weary me, or produce
          within me any sort of unwillingness; but, on the contrary, so long
          as the city was beleaguered, I remained with the band in which I
          had numbered myself, and did in all labours such service as my
          strength would permit. Even among the soldiers that have guarded my
          prison, since I was led into Rome for the sake of that accusation
          which has been brought against me in the matter of my belief,—even
          among them, I have seen the faces of some that were my comrades in
          that fierce war, and that long beleaguerment, who also, if they be
          commanded, will not refuse to bear testimony before you, that all
          these things are true, even as I have said, and that I was a
          faithful soldier, both of Vespasian and of Titus, unto the last.
          Neither, indeed, did I lay down arms immediately when Jerusalem had
          been sacked, and the Temple burnt, according to the prediction of
          Christ, but went with Cæsar along the sea-coast, and was present
          with him all through the journeyings he <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>made in Egypt, even to the day when he made
          his great festival at Alexandria, and crowned the Ox Apis with his
          own hands, in the presence of all that people. On which day it was,
          that, for the first time, I also was accused of being a Christian,
          and at the command of Titus himself, was interrogated by one of the
          rulers of the army.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now with shame and confusion of face must I
          acknowledge, that on that day I, from desire of life, forgot myself
          utterly, and being deserted of all steadfastness, went up to the
          altar in presence of my judge, and offered gifts there, whereon I
          was declared free of all blame; and even received honour and
          commendation thereafter from them, on account of my services in the
          war. But, from that day, my spirit sunk within me, and I knew not
          what to do; I grew weary of all things, and determined to leave the
          band in which I was serving, that I might seek out, if it were
          possible, the habitation of my mother, and make atonement in secret
          for the wickedness of which I, unhappy and fearful man, had been
          guilty at Alexandria. Being absolved, therefore, from my oath of
          service, on account of the length of time I had remained with the
          army, I departed from Egypt, and, after a time, found out my mother
          where she was dwelling in the mountainous country of Palestine, to
          the north of Jerusalem. In going thither, however, I was
          constrained to pass by the place where I had so long lain in your
          camp, O Romans! and to look with my own eyes on the sorrowful
          desolation of that ancient city, where so many holy prophets of the
          Hebrews had ministered, and so many great kings reigned in the days
          of the old time, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg
          129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>when their nation flourished, and was chosen
          and favoured of the Almighty. And it was then, indeed, that I first
          began to repent me of having been present in the host of Titus, and
          of having had a part in that terrible destruction; to which, when I
          added the recollection of my own miserable timorousness at
          Alexandria, great was my perplexity, and I fled across the
          mountains with much speed, seeking in vain to fly from the stings
          and unceasing torment of my own meditations, which nevertheless
          continued ever more and more to sink into my spirit; insomuch, that
          when I came into the place where my mother was dwelling, scarcely
          could she recognize me, wasted and worn as I was with that
          perpetual misery of shame and repentance. Without reproaches,
          however, and indeed with great kindness, did she receive me into
          her habitation, even although, as I have said, she had been much
          offended with me because of my going up to the beleaguerment of the
          city of her fathers. But when I, being humbled, made confession to
          her and her household, and to all the faithful that were in that
          place, of the grievous sin whereof I had been guilty in Egypt, both
          she and all the rest of them busied themselves continually to
          comfort me, and to assure me that there was yet hope, if my
          repentance were sincere, and my resolution immovable never again to
          yield myself to any similar temptation. One of them also, that had
          been set apart to minister in holy things among the scattered
          believers that dwelt up and down in that region, came not many days
          after to the same place, and having publicly heard my confession,
          admitted me once more to be a partaker with them in the mysteries
          of the sanctuary. From which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>day, O Trajan! I have never again been so far
          deserted of myself, as to fall back into that miserable error, or
          by any cowardly word of mine, to deny the faith that is in me,
          which is the faith of the True God that made heaven and earth, and
          of his Son Jesus Christ, whom he sent into the world to teach
          loving-kindness, and long-suffering, and patience, among all
          kindreds, and tongues, and nations of mankind; and to make
          expiation, by the accursed death of the cross, for the evil and the
          wickedness that is in the world. From which faith, should I now
          depart, out of terror for that which, by your command, may befal me
          in this place, of a surety no comfort could ever again come to me
          in my mind, for I should be bowed down, and utterly miserable, out
          of grief and shame; which as you yourself, O Cæsar, will admit and
          acknowledge, is far worse than death itself, or any evil which the
          body of man can sustain. Neither could I have any hope of being
          reconciled unto the True God, whom I should have so, once and
          again, denied; insomuch, that neither in life nor in death should I
          be able to have any happiness;—for in life, what happiness is there
          to him that is ashamed of himself?—and, in departing from life,
          what comfort can be given to him, that, knowing the truth, hath
          openly abjured the truth for the sake of a few, at the utmost, and
          these most miserable and unhappy years? I am an old man, and my
          near kindred and my friends are already dead, so that poor after
          all, and not worthy to be mentioned, is the sacrifice on which I
          have this day resolved. And as for you, O Romans, should I now make
          shipwreck of my faith, and tell a lie to save my life before you,
          with what contempt <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg
          131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>would yourselves be constrained forthwith to
          look upon me? Whosoever is wise among you, according to the
          philosophy of the earth, would utterly despise me; and whosoever is
          brave and steadfast of spirit, would think foul scorn that a
          soldier of Titus should be so much afraid to die. Therefore, O
          Trajan, am I resolved to endure all things rather than sacrifice to
          your gods; and if such be your will, I will not refuse to die for
          this cause, to which witness has already been borne in Rome by the
          blood of holy Apostles, and other noble martyrs of
          Christ.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man,
          having said these words, bowed himself once more reverently before
          Trajan, and then folding his arms in his cloak, appeared to await
          whatever might be appointed. Steadfastly did I look upon his face
          at that moment, to see whether it might exhibit no trace of
          wavering, or at least, if pride barred irresolution, whether,
          nevertheless, there might not appear some token of natural sorrow,
          and human unwillingness to die; yet in vain did I scrutinize and
          seek for any such symptoms of spiritual weakness; for although it
          was visible that, with the exertion of so long standing and
          speaking, to say nothing of thought and anxiety, his bodily
          strength was much spent, still his eye preserved firmness, and his
          brow remained serene; and the parched lips of the old man did not
          once betray the least shadow of trembling. Methinks I see him even
          now, as he then stood—his deep calm eyes sometimes turned upwards
          to Trajan, but for the most part bent to the ground, beneath those
          gray brows of his, whose dark shade rested upon his large solemn
          eyelids. Upon his broad front, as he stooped, no hair appeared, but
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name=
          "Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>long hoary ringlets,
          clustered down on either side, mingling with the venerable,
          although dishevelled beard, that lay upon his bosom. Heroic
          meekness was enthroned visibly upon all his lineaments, and a
          murmur began to run through the assembly, as if—even in a
          Christian—it were not possible to contemplate such things without
          admiration.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as they
          afterwards related to me—for I myself was not indeed sufficiently
          attentive to it—Trajan, who had as yet, during all the occurrences
          of the day, preserved unmoved the majestic serenity of his
          countenance, when he observed this last movement in the spirit of
          the assembly, began all at once to be very indignant, that such
          things should occur in such a place, in consequence of the
          appearance merely, and the language, of a culprit and a Christian.
          I confess it, that I was too much occupied with gazing on Tisias,
          to have any leisure for remarking the particulars of the deportment
          of any other person present—no, not even of Cæsar; yet such had
          been the effect produced on me by the history which the old man
          delivered of himself, that I indeed was not prepared at the moment
          to find the strong arm of power directed ruthlessly, and
          immediately against him. At least, said I to myself, the Prince
          will institute an inquiry among all those now present in the
          capital, who are likely to be able either to contradict
          essentially, or to confirm, the narrative in which this man has
          thought fit to embody his only defence. Many years indeed have
          elapsed since the walls of Jerusalem were shattered by the engines
          of Rome, and the golden gate of its antique temple refused to be
          any protection against the furious soldiery of Titus. Yet surely
          not a few of such as were present in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>that proud host, must be still in life; yea,
          not a few of them must be now present in the capital of the world.
          The old spearman, with whom I talked in the guard-room, and beside
          the ramparts underneath which this Christian was imprisoned, he
          surely cannot be the only witness that remains to give testimony.
          He at least there is, and we shall forthwith have him at least
          confronted with Tisias.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were my
          thoughts within me; judge, therefore, what was my astonishment when
          I heard the trumpet sound, and perceived that its note, without any
          word being spoken, was at once received as a sufficient warning by
          the priests and the vestals, and the youths and the damsels, and
          all those that had in any way been connected with the service of
          the altar, to retire from the place whereon they stood, and leave
          the old man there alone, to await the issue of his destiny.
          Immediately on the signal being given by the trumpet, did all these
          begin to move away; but although in silence they had at first
          marched into the Amphitheatre, they did not retire from it in
          silence. Another hymn, on the contrary, in which also, as it
          seemed, different parts were allotted for each different order of
          singers, was begun to be sung by them even before they had moved
          from the arena; and after the last of their procession had
          disappeared behind the wide folding-doors of the Amphitheatre, we
          still heard their voices chanting solemnly until they had entered
          the great Temple of Isis and Serapis, which, as I have already
          said, stands over against it, on the brink of the Esquiline. And
          while all were yet listening to their singing, and to the harmony
          of lutes and other sweet-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
          134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>sounding instruments that accompanied their
          voices, the slaves and other attendants removed every thing from
          the arena, except only the altar and statue of Jupiter, which were
          still left where they had been placed; insomuch, that ere they had
          made an end of singing, and we of listening, the old man was left
          alone there as at the beginning, when he first came forth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But just when
          deep silence once more prevailed, and expectation was most intense
          concerning what should be at length commanded by Trajan, it fell
          out so, that a little bald ape escaped through the bars of one of
          the grated doors, which were along the boundary-wall of the arena,
          and leaping forth upon the sand, began to skip up and down,
          challenging, by all manner of foolish gestures, the attention of
          those that sate over against it, leaning down from the parapet. And
          immediately certain painted courtezans, that were sitting not far
          from thence, with gilded breasts and bright-coloured garlands, and
          all other gorgeous trappings of the degradation of harlotry, began
          to throw down apples and nuts to the obscene creature, and to
          testify much delight in the grimaces with which it received them,
          hopping to and fro, and casting them away, and then catching them
          up again, with continual gibbering and prating; and no sooner did
          the rabble that were above perceive these things, than they all, as
          with one consent, began to applaud; so that the vaulted vomitories
          and wide arches of entrance, and all the marble walls, re-echoed
          with every wild sound of carelessness and merriment. While, in the
          meantime, the African feeders and naked gladiators, and all those
          hangers-on of the Amphitheatre, whom we had seen in the dark places
          below, hearing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
          135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>now the sounds that had arisen among the
          assembly, began to shew themselves in crowds from behind the same
          grated doors through one of which the monkey had escaped, and to
          partake in the mirth of the spectators, and to whistle upon the
          creature, and to excite it to new caperings, by their outcries and
          jeerings. It seemed as if the minds of all present were entirely
          occupied with the pranks of this brute; and that almost it was
          forgotten amidst the tumult, not only for what purpose all that
          solemn and stately pageantry had just been exhibited before them;
          but even that Tisias was still standing there upon the same
          arena.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For myself, who
          had never before looked upon any creature of this disgusting tribe,
          and had gathered only some general notion of its appearance from
          the treatises of the physiologists and the narratives of
          travellers,—I could not, indeed, refuse to contemplate at first its
          motions with some curiosity; but I knew not, after the scene had
          lasted for a little space, whether to be more humbled within myself
          by the monkey’s filthy mimickings of the form and attitudes of
          mankind, or by the display of brutish heartlessness, which burst
          forth from all that countless multitude, while gazing on that
          spectacle of humiliation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was not
          until my eye fell again on Tisias, who stood all this time solitary
          and silent amidst the hub-bub, that my sorrow and indignation were
          the greatest. There stood the old man even as before, with his arms
          folded in his gown, and his eyes resting on the sand before him,
          pale, calm, and unmoved in his meekness, even as if his ears had
          not once received any sound of all the shoutings and the joyous
          laughters of that unpitying <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>rabble, that had come there to behold him die.
          Once, indeed—it was but once—I thought I could perceive that a
          slight emotion of contempt wreathed for an instant his thin and
          bloodless lips; but it seemed as if that were but the involuntary
          and momentary passing over him of one proud thought, which he cast
          from him immediately, as a thing unworthy of the resolute mind of
          his integrity, choosing rather to array himself in the divine
          armour of patience, than to oppose, with any weapon of human
          passion, the insults heaped upon his head by the cruel callousness
          of that degenerate congregation of men. And, whether it were that
          the sight of all this did not affect me alone with such
          reflections, or only that they in authority were afraid too much of
          the day might be occupied with what formed so unseemly an addition
          to the ordained business of the assembly, while the uproar of mirth
          was yet at its height, certain of the lictors that were about the
          consular chairs leapt down into the arena, and beat the monkey back
          again among the feeders, and other base hirelings, that stood
          behind the grated doors of which I have spoken. Whereupon there was
          at once an end of the tumult, and the lictors having reascended to
          their places, the eyes of all began once more to fix themselves
          upon the Christian.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And he also,
          when he perceived that it was so, and was sensible of the silence
          that once more prevailed, it seemed as if he, too, were aware that
          at last his appointed hour had come, and that he must needs prepare
          himself in good earnest for the abiding of the issue. For, instead
          of continuing steadfast in his place, as he had done during all the
          time he had as yet been exposed there, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>it appeared as if now at length, being
          swallowed up in the contemplation of the approaching fate, he had
          quite forgotten all the rules he had laid down to himself
          concerning his behaviour. Not that he now lost remembrance of the
          courage which hitherto he had manifested, or even, that any the
          least symptom of changeableness was made visible upon his
          countenance. But it seemed to me, of a truth, that of such things
          as he had determined upon within himself before he came thither,
          touching the mere external demeanour of his bodily frame, the
          memory now, in this final moment of expectation, had somewhat
          passed away; for Tisias stood still no longer on the centre of the
          arena; but retaining his arms folded as they had been, and his eyes
          fixed upon the sand, he began to pace rapidly to and fro,
          traversing the open space whereon he alone now was, from side to
          side, without once looking up, or exhibiting any token that he was
          conscious of the presence of any man. By and by, nevertheless, in
          the deeper knittings of his brows, and in the closer pressure of
          his extenuated lips, and then again in the quivering of the nerves
          and muscles upon the arms and legs of the old man, as he moved
          before us, it was testified how keenly the spirit was at work
          within; the strong soul wrestling, it may be, with some last
          stirring temptations of the flesh, and the mind itself not
          altogether refusing to betray its sympathy with the natural
          shudderings of the body. But the moment that the herald of Trajan
          commanded attention in the assembly, and that the Prefect of the
          city began again to prepare himself for speaking, that moment did
          the old man appear to return at once again entirely to himself; and
          he fixed his eyes upon the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Prefect with even the same steadfastness as
          when he made his oration to Cæsar.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By all the gods,”</span> whispered Sabinus at that
          moment, <span class="tei tei-q">“this is a true soldier of
          Vespasian and Titus. He will die for this superstition with the
          constancy of a Roman.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“With all the
          constancy of a philosopher, say rather,”</span> quoth Xerophrastes,
          who had overheard his whisper—<span class="tei tei-q">“yea, with
          all the constancy of a philosopher. Of a surety, there must be some
          lessons of nobility in this faith of the Jews.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now, speak not, but look at the old man,”</span>
          interrupted Rubellia; <span class="tei tei-q">“the signal is given
          for the executioner.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And I looked,
          and saw that the Prefect was standing up in his place, immediately
          below the chair of Trajan, and immediately he began to speak; and
          he said, first looking towards the people,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Let there be silence, and let no man stir in this
          place until this matter be ended.”</span> And then addressing
          himself, as it seemed, to Tisias,—<span class="tei tei-q">“With all
          patience,”</span> proceeded he, <span class="tei tei-q">“have the
          words which this man chose to utter in his defence, been listened
          to; but it must be manifest to all men, that they contain no shadow
          of apology, but rather afford the strongest confirmation of all
          that had before been alleged. Instead of departing from his error,
          or offering any extenuation of its magnitude, his words have tended
          only to shew what was already well known to all that have had any
          dealings with the adherents of this blasphemous sect; that their
          obstinacy is as great as their atheism is perverse; and that no
          clemency can, without blame, be extended to their wilfulness, and
          to the scorn wherewith they are resolved to regard all things
          sacred. Nevertheless, inquiry has been made, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and confirmation has been given, by
          those who were present in the wars of the Divine Titus, as to that
          which this man hath said concerning his own service throughout the
          glorious campaign of Palestine, and the siege of the city of the
          Jews. For which service, it hath seemed right unto Cæsar,
          Ever-Merciful, that no circumstance of needless shame be added to
          the death by which this Christian must now expiate before all them
          who have seen his contempt of the sacrifice of Jupiter, and heard
          his words of blasphemy against all the gods, the guilt of which, it
          is manifest to all, he hath been justly and necessarily accused.
          Let those, therefore, who had been commanded to bring forth a
          tiger, depart now with their beast, and let this man be beheaded
          before the Altar of Jupiter; after which, for this day, the
          assembly will disperse; for, until the morrow, the spectacle of the
          wild animals, which the Prince hath prepared, must be
          deferred.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Prefect made
          his obeisance again to Cæsar, and sate down in his place, and
          immediately one of the doors of the arena was flung open, and there
          entered some slaves, bearing a wooden block upon their shoulders,
          behind whom followed also certain ill-favoured blacks, out of the
          company of African gladiators, one of whom carried bare in his hand
          a long and heavy sword, the surface of which glittered brightly as
          he moved, as if newly sharpened and burnished for the occasion.
          Seeing all which fatal preparations, Tisias immediately flung aside
          the long cloak in which hitherto his arms and all his body had been
          wrapped; and after regarding those that had come in for a moment
          with a steadfast eye, he turned himself to the place where the
          Prefect was sitting, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg
          140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as
          if he had yet one word to say before he should submit himself to
          the sword; whereupon the Prefect said,—<span class="tei tei-q">“If
          the prisoner has yet any thing to offer, it is not too late for
          mercy—Let him speak.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have nothing more to offer, O Romans!”</span>
          answered the old man, <span class="tei tei-q">“as concerning that
          of which I have spoken. But since already some favour has been
          extended to me by reason of my services in the army of Cæsar,
          perhaps so neither will this be refused, that my body may be given
          to such as shall ask for it, that it may be treated without
          indignity after my soul is released.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is granted,”</span> replied the
          Prefect.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Is there any thing
          more?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man was
          silent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With that, the
          block being already fixed upon the sand immediately in front of the
          Altar of Jupiter, one of the Africans moved towards Tisias, as if
          to conduct him to the place where it behoved him to kneel; but he,
          observing what was his intention, forthwith prevented him, and
          walked of himself steadily close up to him in whose hand the sword
          was unsheathed. Being come thither, he immediately took his station
          over against the block, and having for a moment placed his hand
          upon his eyes, and moved his lips, as it seemed, in fervent
          supplication, dropped his one knee on the ground, and stretched
          forth his neck towards the block; but suddenly, after he had done
          so, he sprung again upon his feet, and began to gaze with a keen
          eye all around the assembly, as if he were in search of some one to
          whom he had something yet to say. In vain, however, as it appeared,
          did he make this endeavour; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>for after a little space, he shook his head
          despairingly, and gave over the steadfastness of his look.
          Nevertheless, he lifted up his voice, and, surveying once more the
          whole face of the Amphitheatre round about, from side to side, said
          audibly,—<span class="tei tei-q">“There is one here who made last
          night a promise to me in my dungeon. I cannot see him where he is;
          but I conjure him to take good heed, and execute, as he is a man
          and a Roman, all those things which he said to me he would
          do.”</span> Now, when I heard him say so, I well knew within myself
          that it was for me only his eye had been searching, and half did I
          arise from my seat, that he might see I was there, and observe my
          resolution to keep the faith I had plighted voluntarily to him in
          his prison. But Sabinus, having watched my earnestness in
          contemplating Tisias, and comprehending something of that which was
          meant, held me firm upon the bench, whispering, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As you regard me, Valerius, and as you regard your own
          safety, be still.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Being thus
          constrained, I neither rose up, nor made any attempt to attract the
          attention of Tisias—for which forbearance, I confess to you, I have
          since that day undergone the visitation of not a few bitter
          thoughts—but remained steadily in my place, while the old man once
          more addressed himself to kneel down upon the block that was before
          him. Calmly now at length did he kneel, and with much composure did
          he place himself. Yet, before the gladiator was ready to strike, he
          lifted his head once again, and gazed upwards for a moment towards
          heaven, with such a countenance of faith and hope, that there went
          through all the assembly a murmur, as it were, and a stirring
          breath of admira<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg
          142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>tion. Then bowed he for the last time his gray
          hairs, and almost before he had rested his neck upon the tree, the
          strong sword of the African smote with merciful fierceness, and the
          headless trunk falling backwards upon the sand, the blood spouted
          forth in a gushing stream, and sprinkled all over with red drops
          the base of the statue of Jupiter Capitolinus, and the surface of
          the marble altar, whereupon the sacrifice of the Flamens had been
          offered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The executioner
          having made an end of his duty, wiped his sword from the blood of
          the Christian, and advancing towards the seats of the magistrates,
          claimed the largess that was due to him,—which when he had
          received, as is the custom, he and all his attendants withdrew
          immediately from the arena; the Emperor, at the same moment, and
          the Consulars, and all they that were about him, departing also
          from the assembly; and the whole Amphitheatre speedily being filled
          with the clamours of an universal upbreaking and dispersion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I saw, my
          friends, that you listened with not less of indignation, than of
          astonishment, to the account which I yesterday gave you of a day
          spent in the Amphitheatre of Vespasian. Neither did I expect that
          it should be otherwise with young persons of ingenuous minds, whose
          feelings have never been hardened by any experience of the life of
          Rome.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet, when
          you reflect a little more upon the matter, I think you will abate
          something of the wonder you manifested on hearing of the fondness
          of the Roman people for some of those cruel, ruthful spectacles.
          You will admit, at least, that there is a certain natural
          principle, on an exaggerated and morbid obedience to which, rather
          than on any total and absolute departure from the laws of our mind,
          much of that which excited so much of your astonishment and
          indignation also may be supposed to depend. In and by myself, I
          maintain it must always be a most interesting thing for a man to
          witness, in whatever shape, the last moments of any human creature.
          I mean not those merely corporeal struggles, in which there must
          always be every thing to revolt, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>nothing to interest, because in them, it is
          evident, the nobler part of our nature can have no share—the soul
          being already swallowed up, and its divinity absorbed in the
          intense convulsions of animal suffering. These are things on which
          no eyes can gaze willingly, without indicating degradation of
          spirit. But before that curtain falls, beyond which every one must
          shudder to penetrate, there is a last terrible act of the real
          tragedy, which must ever have power to fix the eyes with an
          earnestness not the less deep, because of its being preceded by
          some struggles of reluctance. We live in a state in which, however
          we may clothe ourselves in the armour of levity, or with the more
          effectual armour of occupation, it is impossible that the one
          fearful idea of dissolution should not ever and anon come to scare
          us with its terrors. We feel that we are walking over a soil, on
          the most level and the most rugged parts of which it is equally
          possible we may meet with the dark pit wherein it is our destiny to
          stumble. How sudden, or how gradual soever the inevitable fall may
          be, we well know we shall have little enough space to prepare
          ourselves for the last leap, when we shall be fairly on the
          declivity; and I maintain, once more, that it is a rational, no
          less than a natural, curiosity, which leads us to seek to supply,
          in some measure, this necessary defect, and to gather, if possible,
          from witnessing the last moments of others, some hints which may be
          of use to us when our own dark hour shall come. We see a being
          standing on the edge of a precipice, to which the only thing we
          know certainly, is, that we ourselves shall one day be brought; and
          shall it be possible to feel no curiosity concerning the manner in
          which he con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg
          145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ducts himself on that giddy brink? That which
          is denied to us in our own person, may, in part, be supplied in
          his; and the eyes which dwell upon his features, while they are
          filled with the overwhelming expectation of near approaching death,
          make the closest approximation of which our nature admits to
          penetrating the actual mysteries of the unseen region. For myself,
          both wiser and better did I come away from all that mournful
          spectacle. But perhaps I am joining together things which, after
          all, had no necessary connection, when I ascribe to my
          contemplation of the death of Tisias, and the other cruel sights
          which, as it seemed, were regarded with indifference by the great
          multitudes around me, so much of the change which, about this
          period, my own spirit underwent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slumbers
          which followed that busy day of novelties and terrors, were long
          and heavy; for utterly worn out were both mind and body, and youth
          hastened to repair the waste of its energies, by drinking deeply at
          the great fountain of natural refreshment. Nevertheless, although
          the hand of sleep had lain steadily upon me, when I awoke in the
          already-confirmed light of morning, I found myself yet filled with
          a confused and tremulous sense of excitation, as if the spirit had
          disdained to be idle after having received so much food for
          activity, and Fancy had still been garnishing the passive sphere of
          the night with aerial representations of all the gorgeous and
          solemn realities of the by-past day. I lay there ruminating amidst
          the dispersing shadows of the mysterious world of dreams, and
          scarcely as yet aware that a whole night had passed since I had
          returned from the Amphitheatre, when I was at length roused to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name=
          "Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a sudden and complete
          recollection of all things by the entrance of Boto.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My dear master,”</span> said he, making a sort of
          start after he had come in, <span class="tei tei-q">“I was afraid
          you would be angry with me for not coming to you sooner, but now I
          perceive you have been as lazy as the rest of us. Why, surely, you
          are not aware what time of day it is! What would my dear old lady
          over the water say, if she heard of my young master lying in bed
          till within three hours of noon? Oh, what a place is this you have
          brought me to! Why, when I awake in the morning, the first thought
          that comes into my head always is, What, Boto, and is it really
          possible that all that wide roaring sea lies between you and the
          green banks of quiet Anton? Is it truth, good truth, and neither
          dream nor witching, that you, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Boto</span></span>, are in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></span>?
          But I sometimes have to jump up, and take a look out of the window
          before I am quite convinced; and then, to be sure, I know well
          enough that I, who used always to dream about driving cattle to
          Venta, and perhaps kissing a Brigian lass by the way, could never
          dream of so many fine things unless I were really among them. Good
          heavens! what a heap of stories I shall have to tell, when we get
          safe back to Old Britain!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed,
          Boto,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“you will be quite a
          travelled man. Be sure you do not give yourself too many airs on
          the occasion.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Travelled man, in
          faith,”</span> replied the clown. <span class="tei tei-q">“I should
          like to know, who it is that will be able to hold up his head with
          me, when I am once fairly back again? Oh, how the old smith will be
          humbled! He thought himself such a mighty person, because my old
          master, your father, had taken him with him as far as Camolodunum,
          and how <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg

          used to brag of what he had seen there; but now, I trow, Master
          Pernorix will be fain to talk quietly about his journeys.—O Rome,
          Rome! what fine things shall I have to tell them all about
          Rome,—and the lions, and the monkeys, and Cæsar, and the elephants,
          and the fighting men, and the Christian, and all the wonderful
          sights we saw yesterday. But the worst of it is, that nobody will
          ever be able to believe one half of what I shall tell them.—And
          when does my dear Master Valerius think we shall be returning to my
          old lady, and all the rest of them in Britain?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of a truth, good Boto,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that is more than I can pretend to give you any notion
          of; but I dare say, you shall have both time and opportunity to
          pick up a few more marvels still before we go. In the meantime, you
          are comfortable, I hope, in your quarters, and Dromo takes good
          heed of you.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Dromo,”</span> quoth
          he, looking as arch as his massive features would admit
          of,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Dromo, indeed!—If I had nobody to
          trust to but him, I should be very ill off. Dromo is a great man;
          the young lord of the house has him up in his chamber every day to
          talk with him by himself; and when he comes down again, or returns
          from any of the errands he is sent out upon, there is no bearing
          with him in the court-yard, where we are all huddled together. As
          for the overseer, old Sarcalus, the freed-man, he has quite given
          him up. Nobody dare speak about whipping him; he looks upon himself
          as almost as important a person as his master, I believe, if the
          truth were known; and yet I should not complain, for, after all, it
          was Dromo that carried me yesterday to the
          Amphitheatre.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ay, that was very
          kind of Dromo—I should have <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>thought of it myself. And did he not see that
          you got your supper snugly, when you came
          back?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah! now, master, don’t make
          them whip me—I see they have told you all.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“All!”</span> said I—<span class="tei tei-q">“I do
          assure you they have told me nothing about you; but come, speak
          out. It must be something very bad that would make me think of
          having you whipt. You have only been three days in Rome—I shall
          make allowance for a few vagaries, provided they be not very
          extravagant.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, then, Master
          Caius,”</span> quoth he, <span class="tei tei-q">“since they have
          told you nothing beforehand, and you seem inclined to be so
          good-natured with me, I shall e’en tell you all myself, and I hope
          you won’t think me, after all, very much to
          blame.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Speak out, my honest Boto,
          and remember there is Dromo also to be examined, in case you keep
          any thing back from me.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ah!
          master, but Dromo would not be so easily caught as poor Boto. Dromo
          is a cunning man, and a close; and besides, they say he was born in
          a city they call Crete, and the people of that place can’t speak a
          word of truth, even although they were willing. Do not think any
          thing at all about Dromo; but trust entirely to your own poor Boto,
          and he will tell you every thing. Dromo is a sad dog.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I know not what
          more he might have proceeded to say concerning Dromo, had not that
          crafty Cretan, who, without question, had been listening all the
          while behind the door, just at that moment glided in on very
          delicate tiptoe, and coming close up behind the British slave, as
          he stood in the act of haranguing me, smote him a smart fillip upon
          the cheek with the back of his fingers, mimicking, at the same
          time, the outlandish accent of the man, and repeating after him
          into his tinkling <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg
          149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ears, the words, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dromo is a sad
          dog—Dromo is a cunning man, and a close—Dromo would not be so
          easily caught as poor Boto</span></span>.—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ha, ha! Master Valerius,”</span> then said he to me,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and so you would really take the trouble
          to ask questions of this worthy man, when you had it in your power
          to send for me? I thought it had not been for nothing that three
          persons I could name entered upon a certain alliance—but ’tis all
          one to the Cretan.—Both Sextus, and you, may manage your own
          affairs for yourselves, if such be your pleasure.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I knew not on
          this whether to be more amazed with the impudence of the Cretan, or
          the confusion of poor Boto, who stood rubbing his cheek with a
          strangely mingled aspect of sheepishness and sulkiness; but Dromo
          soon put an end to the affair, by turning round with a face of
          admirably feigned astonishment to my Briton, and saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Good heavens! Boto, are you still there?
          Do you not perceive that your master and I have something to say to
          each other in private? Begone, my good man—shall I never be able to
          render you susceptible of the smallest polish?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These last words
          being accompanied with a gentle push on the back, soon expelled
          poor Boto, who, nevertheless, did not depart without casting
          towards me a look of woful appeal over his shoulder. But I
          perceiving plainly, in the midst of all his frolicsome behaviour,
          that Dromo had really something to say to me; and suspecting, of
          course, that the interest of Sextus might be concerned in what he
          had to say, suffered my slave to withdraw in good earnest. Dromo,
          after the door was shut, laid his finger upon his lip, and stood
          still for a moment in an attitude of close attention; but
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name=
          "Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the heavy heels of
          the reluctant Briton were heard with great distinctness, lumbering
          along the marble floor of the gallery; so, being satisfied that
          there was no eavesdropping in the case, the varlet seated himself
          forthwith in a posture of great familiarity on the nether end of my
          couch, and, to judge from the expression of his countenance, seemed
          evidently to be preparing himself for a disclosure of some
          importance. At length, after not a few winks of much intelligence,
          it was thus he began:—<span class="tei tei-q">“You may hear Boto’s
          story, sir, at any time you please, and I dare say it will amuse
          you; but, in the meantime, I must really have you attend to me,
          for, without jesting, things are by no means in so fair a train as
          I had thought for my young master; and if something effectual be
          not speedily discovered, I am really at a loss to think how we
          shall be able to get out of our difficulties, in such a manner as
          may be either satisfactory to him, or creditable to my management.
          But you had better get up and dress yourself, and while you are
          doing so, I will tell you every thing.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I did as he bade
          me, and then the Cretan proceeded:—<span class="tei tei-q">“As I
          was coming out of the Amphitheatre yesterday, I happened to find
          myself rubbing shoulders with a certain old fat Calabrian, whom I
          had seen before about Rubellia’s house in the Suburra, and thinking
          that no harm could possibly come of being civil to him, I began
          immediately to ask his opinion of the spectacles. I wish you had
          been there to see how much he was delighted with the attention I
          paid him, and how he plumed himself on being admitted to talk on
          such subjects with such a person as me; for the man himself is but
          an ignorant fellow, and seems never to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>have kept company but with the grooms and
          hinds. From less to more, we began to be the greatest friends in
          the world; and by the time we got to the Arch, it was evident that
          we could not possibly part, without having a cup together to cement
          the acquaintance. Well, we were just about to dive into one of the
          wine-cellars there, below the gate-way, when I saw your friend Boto
          standing by himself in the middle of the street, apparently quite
          a-gaze and bewildered, and not able to form the smallest guess
          which way he ought to take in order to reach home; and being a
          good-natured fellow, in spite of all that has been said, I
          immediately shouted out his name till he was compelled to hear me,
          and then beckoned to him to come along with us, which indeed he did
          without much coaxing.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well, Dromo,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and so all your great news is, that you have been
          leading my Briton into one of your debauches? In truth, I think you
          need not have made such an affectation of mystery
          withal.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Stop now,”</span> quoth
          he, cutting me short; <span class="tei tei-q">“if the slave be too
          slow, I am sure the master’s quickness will make up for it.—Hear me
          out before you begin commenting; such interruptions would bring the
          Stagyrite himself to a stand. We were soon, all three of us, seated
          in one of those snug little places, which if you have not yet seen,
          you are ignorant of the most comfortable sight within all the four
          walls of Rome,—a quiet cleanly little place,—three good hassocks
          upon the floor, a handful of sausages, a plate of dried fish as
          broad as the shield of Ajax, and a good old fashioned round-bellied
          jolly jug of Surrentine in the midst of us. I dare say, there were
          a hundred besides employed in the same <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>way in the house; but we shut the door, and
          were as private as behind the altar of Vesta.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A tempting scene, Dromo; and what use did you make of
          your privacy?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“All in good time,
          Master Valerius; you would have the apple before the egg. We had
          scarcely emptied our first jug, ere the conversation between the
          Calabrian and me took a turn that was not quite unnatural; for
          slaves, however little you may trust them, will always be smelling
          out something of the truth; and you may be sure, all this visiting,
          and feasting, and riding about in chariots, and sitting together at
          the Amphitheatre, has not been going on, without causing a good
          deal of talk both in this house and the rich widow’s. The courtship
          was of course the subject of our conversation, and I, pretending to
          know nothing of it myself, except from the common report of the
          slaves about our house, affected to consider it as highly probable,
          that the fat Calabrian might have had much better opportunities
          than mine of being informed how the affair really
          stood.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And did he really seem to have any knowledge about
          it?”</span> said I.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Not much—not much; but
          still the man did tell me something that I think may turn out to be
          well worth the knowing. <span class="tei tei-q">‘I am sure,’</span>
          said I, (by this time Boto was fast asleep,)—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘I am sure, if Rubellia won’t have my young master, it
          won’t be for want of presents; for we all know he has already given
          her a whole casket of rings and bracelets that belonged to his
          mother, and he is sitting for his picture, which, they say, he is
          to give her besides.’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘And
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">I</span></span> am sure,’</span> quoth the
          Calabrian in return, <span class="tei tei-q">‘that if your young
          master don’t have my lady, it won’t be for want of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>presents neither; for she is the most
          generous open-handed lady in the world, and that her worst enemies
          will allow, although her father be an old rogue, and an usurer, as
          all the town says he is. No, Dromo,’</span> continued he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘nor will it be for want of philtres, nor
          of charms, nor of any thing that soothsaying can procure; for,
          between ourselves, my lady keeps up a constant traffic of late with
          all that sort of gentry; and what the issue of it all may be,
          Hecate only knows.’</span> Now, Master Valerius, when I heard him
          speak of philtres and charms, you may be sure I began to quicken up
          my ears more keenly than ever.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dromo!”</span> said I; <span class="tei tei-q">“you
          are not serious. You do not mean surely to make me think that you
          believe in the efficacy of love-potions, or any such
          quackeries?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Quackeries! do you
          call philtres quackeries? Why, there was a girl once gave myself a
          philtre that kept me raving for six months.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What sort of a looking girl was she, good
          Dromo?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Bah!”</span> quoth he;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“don’t expect to jeer me out of memory as
          well as judgment. Heavens and earth! when did any body ever hear of
          any body denying the efficacy of philtres? What an atheistical sort
          of barbarians those Britons must be. I wonder you are not afraid of
          some evil coming upon you. Remember Dian’s handful; remember the
          fate of Actæon!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Good
          Dromo,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose you also
          suffered from peeping. But talk seriously; are you yourself a
          dealer in philtres, that you are so anxious I should believe in
          their power? Or what is your meaning?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My meaning is this,”</span> quoth he, with great
          vehemence,—<span class="tei tei-q">“it is, that if Rubellia gives
          Sextus such another <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg
          154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>philtre as a certain cunning damsel gave me,
          before I left pleasant Crete, to be a drudge and a packhorse here
          in Rome, where a man may sweat all his life in another’s service
          without being once thanked for his pains, and perhaps be laid out,
          look ye, for a supper to the vultures at last, because no body will
          treat his carcase to a blaze of old sticks,—I say, that if the Lady
          Rubellia contrives to give Sextus such another philtre as that, the
          game’s up, Master Valerius; and we may as well set about painting
          the dead, as try to save him from her clutches. The man’s gone—he’s
          as lost as Troy.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Well,
          Dromo,”</span> said I, for I perceived there was no use in fighting
          it with him, <span class="tei tei-q">“and have you not been able to
          hit upon any feasible scheme?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ay,
          have you come to that at last? that is just what I have been
          cudgelling my brains about for the last twelve hours. But if I do
          hit upon any thing, I shall need assistance. In such cases, the
          best judgment can do nothing by itself.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Fear not, Dromo,”</span> quoth I; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“if my assistance can do you any good, you well know
          you can command it to the utmost.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then prepare,”</span> replied the Cretan, rising up
          with an air of much solemnity—<span class="tei tei-q">“then prepare
          in good earnest; for, may Cerberus growl upon me, if I don’t find
          out some scheme before another day goes over, and shew you all what
          stuff I am made of. To think of entrapping Sextus without
          consulting Dromo!—No, by Cretan Jove, she shall not accomplish
          it—no, not even with a sea of philtres.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And, in the meantime,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what must Sextus do with himself?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He must not go near the Suburra; he must remain
          closely at home; and as for tasting any thing at her house, or any
          thing that comes from her—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg
          155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by
          heavens, if he does not take his oath against that—we may as well
          leave him to his destiny. If he will but take good care for this
          one day, I think there is every chance something may be hit upon
          ere the morning. I have got my cue, and shall not be idle, I
          promise you; but I undertake nothing, unless you swear to keep
          Sextus safe, and at a distance from her, till
          night-fall.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Good Dromo,”</span>
          said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“make yourself easy on that score;
          it will be a new circumstance indeed, if we find any difficulty in
          persuading Sextus to stay a single day away from the
          Suburra.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Persuading!”</span> quoth the slave; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“who ever heard of such a word as persuasion at such a
          crisis as this? I tell you he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">must</span></span> be kept away; and if no
          other plan can be fallen on, I have a great mind to turn the key on
          him and his pedagogue both together. I heard them hammering at
          their lessons already as I came along—and that puts me in mind that
          I have a very shrewd notion there is more between that bearded goat
          of ours and this Rubellia, than any of us had been suspecting.
          Unless that Calabrian lies—and I think lying is above his
          sphere—this old rogue has been oftener in the Suburra of late than
          we had any thought of. So help me Hermes! I believe Licinius has
          been employing him to go his private messages to Rubellia—but that
          is only one insult more, and I shall have my revenge all in a
          lump.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I think it very likely,”</span> answered I, quietly,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that Licinius may have been employing
          Xerophrastes in some such embassies; and, if I mistake not the
          matter, he would feel himself quite as much in his element,
          trotting along the Sacred Way, and so forth, on such <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>delicate errands for the father, as in
          expounding musty parchments to the son.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No matter for all that,”</span> quoth Dromo, rubbing
          his hands; <span class="tei tei-q">“the more enemies the more
          glory. Would Miltiades have been pleased had the Spartans
          arrived?—Leave all to me—take you care only of Sextus, and I am not
          afraid for any reinforcement that rascally rhetorician may bring
          against me.”</span>—While he was saying so, the face of the Cretan
          exhibited symptoms of incipient glee; and he concluded with
          snapping his fingers, and uttering a short keen whistle, such as
          you have heard from the lips of a hunter, when the dogs begin to
          bay around a thicket.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing his eyes
          dance with the expectation of some bustling scene, I could not help
          participating, in some measure, in the feelings of the Cretan; and,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Dear Dromo,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I beseech you, if it be possible, let me have a share
          in whatever you resolve upon.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Watch well,”</span> replied he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“during the day, and you shall see what you shall see,
          when the moon mounts above the Cœlian, and the hour for grubbing
          among herbs and bones is come.—But now I hear some one coming—it is
          Licinius.”</span>—Dromo, finger on lip, glided from the room. Nor
          had his well-practised ears deceived him, for he scarcely vanished,
          before my kinsman entered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Valerius,”</span> said he, saluting me affectionately,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I thought you were probably much fatigued
          with your spectacles, so I desired that nobody should call you this
          morning; but I met Boto in the hall, and hearing that you were
          astir, I have come up, for I wish a little private conversation.
          Shall we walk in the eastern portico, till Xerophrastes leaves
          Sextus at liberty?”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He led the way
          along the gallery, and in passing, we also heard the deep voice of
          the rhetorician resounding among the pillars, and could even catch
          a few of the magniloquent phrases with which he was feeding the
          ears of his pupil. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ay, ay,”</span> says
          Licinius, <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish, indeed, it were possible
          to inspire the youth with some sense of what is due to the dignity
          of principle, and how absurd it is to think of gratifying whims at
          the expense of duty. But I fear the boy is incorrigible; and,
          Caius, I am sorry to say, I suspect you have been looking on his
          errors with a countenance rather of favour and of confirmation,
          than, as I should have expected, of rebuke.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Licinius,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
          know not how much you distress me. I could rather die than
          encourage Sextus in any thing I thought evil; but, indeed, I have
          seen nothing to make me imagine him capable of such
          conduct.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come, by Hercules,”</span> returned he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there is no occasion for so many words. I thought it
          very odd that you went away so soon from the Forum the other day,
          considering that you had never been there before; but I thought it
          doubly and trebly remarkable that Sextus should have accompanied
          you, when the case in hand affected the affairs of Rubellia. But I
          have since found out that it was not the society of old Capito
          which attracted him—no, my friend, nor yet the alarm of a thunder
          storm that detained you at the villa. In a word, Valerius, I
          strongly suspect that Sextus is carrying on an intrigue with a
          young lady whom I never saw, but who, I am quite sure, will never
          be mistress of a dozen lizards, and that this is the true cause of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name=
          "Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his reluctance
          concerning a match, which, to say nothing of the pleasure it would
          give to me, is the only means by which I can see any prospect of
          the young man’s fortune being made, and the dignity of his family
          kept up, after another effigy shall have been added to our hall.
          Infatuated and headstrong boy! if he owes nothing to himself or to
          me, is it possible that he can look upon that venerable line of
          sages and heroes, without feeling shame in the degradation of his
          own earth-stooping desires?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Without question,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you allude to the Lady Rubellia, whom, as I have heard
          from various quarters, you are desirous of seeing wedded to
          Sextus.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes, Caius Valerius, it is indeed to her I allude; and
          it is of the obstacle which—unwittingly, I doubt not—you yourself
          have been throwing in the way of that union, that I have now to
          make my complaint. Not such the service that I had expected from my
          kinsman. Rubellia is descended from a noble family, and, both in
          possession and expectation, her wealth is great. Two heavy fines
          laid upon me by Domitian, and the expense at which I have
          maintained my rank among the great patrons of Rome—these things
          together have impoverished me, and to an extent not altogether
          convenient. In this boy my hopes were placed; and see now how they
          are all likely to be blasted for a dimpled cheek and a pair of
          wanton eyes!—or rather, indeed, I should say, for the sake of the
          malignant pleasure that is derived from thwarting my purposes; for,
          if beauty were what the boy wanted, where should he find beauty
          beyond Rubellia? Perhaps, Caius, I should, before this time, have
          made <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name=
          "Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>you acquainted with
          my intentions from my own lips. But it is my own foolish indulgence
          which has made my degenerate boy quite forget, not only what is the
          duty of a son, but what is the power of a father.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I trust,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there is no need for all this seriousness. Sextus has
          only laid aside the garb of a stripling; it is too much to be
          despairing of his success in life, only because he is unwilling, at
          a period so early, to enter upon a permanent connection. Is it
          possible, that, if he really dislike Rubellia, you would wish to
          see him marry her—only to divorce her, without question, as soon as
          he should find it possible to do so without
          inconvenience?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Handsome, rich,
          noble, and almost as young as himself, why, in the name of all the
          gods, for what cause should he divorce
          Rubellia?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said I,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“he loves not Rubellia, nor will ever love
          her; and if you cause your son to marry this woman, look you well
          to it, that the unhappiness of both rest not on your head.
          Handsome, rich, noble, and young she may be; but I am sure, she has
          neither such a heart, nor such a mind, as should belong to the wife
          of your Sextus. A luxurious woman is Rubellia, and I have seen her
          find luxury in the contemplation of blood. Wed not Rubellia to your
          son.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Peace, Valerius,”</span> he
          answered; <span class="tei tei-q">“what boyish nonsense is this?—I
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">will</span></span> wed Rubellia to my son; and
          let him see to it, that he tempts me not farther with his
          disobedience.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Licinius said
          these last words in a voice of so much earnestness, that I knew not
          well what answer to make to him; but while I was hesitating, one of
          the little boys about the house, (I mean the children of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name=
          "Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>domestic slaves,)
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If it please my lord, the same
          senator that was here in the morning is waiting in the
          hall.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Pontius Mamurra!”</span>
          said the orator, leaving me.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I, for my part,
          when I heard the name of the visiter, began to understand somewhat
          of the channel through which my kinsman had been informed about
          what had passed at the Suburban. I had no leisure, however, to
          reflect long upon this hint; for I found Sextus waiting for me.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> he said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I was afraid I must set off without you. My father has
          been looking on me this morning with such an aspect of displeasure
          as I rarely before witnessed in him, and if I defer going to the
          painter about this likeness, he will be altogether enraged at
          supper-time. I know very well he means the ring, in which it is to
          be placed, for another present to Rubellia; but notwithstanding,
          what can I do? Any opposition to him in lesser matters would only
          tend to bring on some final explanation about the great affair
          itself, and that, whether it be weakness in me or not, I as yet
          have no courage to encounter. The man must be expecting me; and I
          am sure you will accompany me, for I have much need of you to keep
          up my heart. Xerophrastes, indeed, has been desired to go with me;
          but he will be no comfort, for I see plainly, from the drift of his
          harangues, that he is enlisted against me. Dear Caius, I have
          nobody in the whole world I can trust to but Dromo and
          yourself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had scarcely
          said so, when we heard Xerophrastes pacing up and down with solemn
          strides in the gallery; so I knew not how to excuse myself,
          although I was very <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg
          161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>anxious to have staid at home for another
          purpose. Sextus had taken my gown from the nail; he threw it over
          my shoulders before I had time to say any thing, and we were soon
          on our way to his ungrateful destination.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had to
          traverse a considerable part of the city; for this painter was one
          of those who exercise their art during the public hours of the day
          in the baths of the Palatine, where, as you have heard, in the wide
          circuit of the princely residence, abundant accommodation is set
          forth for all such ingenious persons. We proceeded along the edge
          of the river, and by the west of the Capitol, following the line of
          that great Triumphal Way which has been witness of so many glorious
          pageants; for so, they told me, we should most easily ascend into
          the Cæsarian courts. But when we had come thither, we found the
          whole open space, in front of the portico and stairs of Trajan,
          occupied by a detachment of the Prætorian cohorts, drawn up in
          splendid array to receive some promised donative; while the music,
          and the clamours of their mustering, had collected enough of
          spectators to render the passage onwards in some measure difficult.
          We were constrained to form part of their attendance, and stood
          gazing among the multitude. Even Xerophrastes caught some animation
          from the brilliancy of the spectacle; and the enamoured and
          perplexed Sextus himself, beating time on my shoulder, seemed to
          have forgotten, for a moment, the anxieties of his
          situation.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg
          163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some horsemen,
          however, riding along to keep the ground open in front of the
          soldiery, compelled us to shift to the eastward, where many
          chariots were drawn up—and in one of these Rubellia. The lady
          looked paler than I had before seen her, and had not the air of
          being in the smallest degree occupied with what was passing. I did
          not think it necessary to take any notice of her being there to my
          companions, and was willing, indeed, to keep myself turned away
          from the place where she sat, in order to avoid our being
          recognized. Yet there was something in her aspect and attitude,
          that, as by a sort of fascination, drew my eyes to the spot I
          wished to avoid. From time to time, therefore, I felt myself
          constrained to regard the melancholy lady; and by and by, Sextus
          perceived what it was that attracted my attention:—so I discovered,
          although he said not a word, from a fervent pressure upon my arm as
          I stood before him. At that moment there drew near a little ugly
          old woman, with no covering upon her head but long coarse gray
          clusters of hair hanging matted and twisted down upon her
          shoulders, who lifted up a basket of trinkets, and presented it;
          but Rubellia started on her seat, and, looking in the face of the
          old creature, manifested signs of no trivial emotion; for her
          colour returned with a sudden flush, and her eyes recovered all
          their animation, and it was evident she had something to say which
          could not regard the gaudy ornaments offered to her view. Whatever
          it was, however, she did not occupy much time in saying it; for
          scarcely a minute elapsed before the basket was lowered again, and
          the old woman began to move towards another part of the crowd; on
          which Rubellia sunk <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg
          164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>back in her chariot, and appeared to relapse
          into pensive abstraction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Presently a low
          voice croaking out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Rings, rings—amulets
          and rings!”</span> amongst the crowd that stood immediately behind
          me; and I perceived the same woman pushing her basket between
          Xerophrastes and Sextus.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Noble
          youth,”</span> quoth the hag, leering, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lovely young gentleman—sweet Adonis, my charming lord,
          do now look into old Pona’s basket—do take a look at Ponula’s rings
          and amulets—her amulets and rings. Here is one that I could have
          sold a hundred times, but I was determined to keep it till I should
          see the prettiest young gentleman in Rome, and I will never go back
          to Naples without selling it, after this day; for this little
          amulet must be nobody’s but yours. You will break my heart, my
          prince, if you buy not my beautiful amulet.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And what,”</span> said Sextus, blushing and laughing,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“may be the virtues of your
          amulet?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then laying her
          yellow hand upon his shoulder, till she had made him stoop down so
          that she might get close to his ear, she began to pour out, with
          much mysterious volubility, all the story of its marvellous
          potencies; but what she said even I could not know, only I heard
          the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Æthiopian, Æthiopian,”</span>
          and <span class="tei tei-q">“Memnon, Memnon,”</span> and something
          about <span class="tei tei-q">“not a pretty lady in Rome.”</span>
          But just as the woman was most earnest in her whisper, and Sextus,
          apparently at least, in listening, I found my gown plucked from
          behind, and behold, there was Dromo, with a countenance tremulously
          agitated, and white as a piece of dead parchment, pointing to his
          young master and the old hag, and beseeching me to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>separate them, by motions in nowise to
          be mistaken. How he had come thither, or what was the cause of this
          anxiety, I had no time to conjecture, for before I could say a
          word, he began to bellow out,—<span class="tei tei-q">“The horses,
          the horses—make room for the horses;”</span> and immediately those
          that stood near him began to move a little, and then, the cry being
          repeated, those that stood farther off mistaking the noise of their
          feet for the approach of some new squadron, there arose a sort of
          rushing among the crowd; and, in a twinkling, the voice of Pona was
          heard grumbling and croaking at a distance from the place to which
          our party were borne. Close, nevertheless, did the faithful Cretan
          stick to us; and no sooner was quiet in some measure restored, and
          the false alarm he had created at an end, than he whispered into my
          ear, <span class="tei tei-q">“For the sake of all that is sacred,
          let not that foul hag speak another word to my young master—I will
          tell you more anon. Meantime, haste ye, haste ye. Make the best of

          your way thither, than it was for me to reach you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My friend being
          already weary of the heat and the pressure, we were ready to take
          advantage of an opening pointed out by the Cretan. It so happened,
          however, that in the same commotion the chariot of Rubellia also
          had changed its situation; for just as we had escaped, as I
          thought, and were about to place our feet on the magnificent flight
          of stairs that leads from the New Way to the Augustan Towers, there
          came to us a lad of that lady’s household, who told us she was near
          at hand, and desirous, if it so pleased us, of our company. Aware
          that we were in sight, how could we disobey? We <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>found the lady in her chariot, but not
          such as we had seen her before. On the contrary, the liveliness of
          her aspect seemed now to be restored, and she received us with her
          usual gaiety of address. <span class="tei tei-q">“Careless
          men,”</span> said she, as we drew near; <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          suppose I might have sat here till the Greek Kalends, before any
          one of you would have observed me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Most noble lady,”</span> quoth Xerophrastes,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“bear it not indignantly, that amidst all
          the confusion of men and horses, and trumpets and shoutings, our
          attention was abstracted from that which was most worthy of notice.
          My young friends deserve to be excused, since even I, who am not in
          the habit of being much troubled by such vanities, was so
          bewildered that I scarcely knew my right hand from my left, in this
          human chaos.—Pardon, noble Rubellia; we have been unwitting
          offenders.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And was it so?”</span> said the lady, not looking at
          the Stoic.—<span class="tei tei-q">“But I did not call for you to
          hear useless apologies. What new sight is it that attracts you to
          the Palatine?—or is it only that you are desirous of exhibiting to
          Valerius the old-established wonders of the place? In either case,
          I have half a mind to accompany you. In spite of all they tell us
          about the Golden House, I can scarcely think the Palatine shewed
          more splendidly than it does now, even in the days of
          Nero.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Indeed,”</span> said I, as we began to mount together
          the broad slabbed steps which rise up, tier above tier, from the
          portico on the street, to that which hangs on the brow—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Indeed, it is not easy for me to doubt that Rubellia
          is in the right.”</span>—For now, on one side, were <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all the pillars and arches of the Forum
          stretched out below us, and, on the other, lay the great Circus,
          topped with its obelisk; while before rose the gray cliffs of the
          Capitoline, with their domes and proud pinnacles in the glow of
          noontide—the space between, radiant with arms and banners. Even
          Xerophrastes did not refrain from some ejaculations.—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Illustrious Rome! how great is thy sublimity!”</span>
          And then, after a pause, he repeated, in a voice of much majesty,
          those verses from the Fury of Ajax:</p>

          hints which had reached me concerning his nativity recurring to my
          recollection, I could not help echoing his quotation with another
          from the Æneid, about the wide tracts ploughed by the Thracians; of
          which impertinence the sage took no notice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was
          admiration diminished when, having gained the top of that massive
          staircase, or rather, as I should say, hill of marble, we passed
          beneath the sounding portal, the sole remnant of the original pile
          of Augustus, and found ourselves within the first of those great
          imperial quadrangles, by which the whole summit of that once so
          variously and multitudinously peopled region is now occupied. The
          light and airy porticoes—the domes—the princely towers—the
          universal profusion of marble, brass, ivory, flaming gold, lavished
          on arch, metope, and architrave—all conspired to dazzle the sight,
          and I stood still to gaze.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          hand. I have heard my father say that they mark the sites of two
          houses, which, before Augustus began to enclose the whole Palatine
          in his walls, were inhabited, the one by Cicero, the other by
          Clodius; these are the only traces of their mansions.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What grim-looking figures!”</span> said the lady;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“yet, I dare say, they don’t cast half such
          fierce looks on each other, as the predecessors you mention. I
          should like to have seen the countenance of old Tully, the morning
          he went down the hill to deliver his harangue for Milo.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am glad,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that Sextus has told me this; for in reading those
          famous philippics in time to come, I shall possess a new key to the
          bitterness of their phraseology, knowing, as I do, that the two
          lived just over the way from each other, and that the orator, when
          his spirits were flagging, could derive a new reinforcement of
          spleen from merely putting his head out of the
          window.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“To hear you,”</span> says
          Rubellia, <span class="tei tei-q">“one would think you were
          studying the art of making philippics—I am afraid, that if it be
          so, my joining your party may prove to have been but an ill-judged
          thing; for if any of you be preparing to abuse me, my presence will
          serve to sharpen your weapons.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“In
          that case, however,”</span> interrupted the smiling Xerophrastes,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“my noble lady will admit, that the
          converse also will hold good, and that if praise be in meditation,
          it will not be the feebler because the subject of the intended

          "tei tei-q">“Most courteous of men,”</span> replied the lady,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“who talks of the stiffness of the Porch?

          continued, (gazing as she spoke, with all her eyes upon
          Sextus,)—<span class="tei tei-q">“if all were as profuse, I should
          be unable to sustain the weight of their
          civilities.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, Oh! generous
          lady,”</span> quoth the sage again, <span class="tei tei-q">“it
          must be remembered, that, as the poet has expressed it, there are
          two kinds of shame—there is the wicked shame and the good shame.
          Why should it be doubted, that a modest Verecundity, not unsuitable
          to their age, has laid her finger on the lips of our young friends?
          I swear by the Victrix of Ida, that your presence itself is that
          which occasions their silence;—bear it not ill—bear it not
          harshly—the young will learn—not every one has seen
          Corinth.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“No, truly,”</span>
          answered the laughing lady; <span class="tei tei-q">“but I doubt
          whether they that have been so fortunate, have ever seen any thing
          half so fine as what now awaits Valerius.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She pointed to
          the solemn Doric columns which sustain the portico of the famous
          Temple of Apollo, whose shade lay far out upon the court before us;
          and, passing between those brazen horsemen, we soon began to ascend
          the steps that lead up to the shrine. Nor can I tell you how
          delightful was the fragrant coolness, which reigned beneath the
          influence of that massive canopy of marble, to us whose eyes had
          been so long supporting the meridian blaze. We entered with slow
          steps within the vestibule of the Temple, and stood there for some
          space, enjoying in silence the soft breath of air that played
          around the flowing fountains. Then passing on, the airy hall
          received us; and I saw the statue of Phœbus presiding, like a
          pillar of tender light, over the surrounding darkness of the
          vaulted place; for, to the lofty shrine of the God of day no
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name=
          "Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>light of day had
          access, and there lay only a small creeping flame burning thin upon
          his altar; but a dim and sweet radiance, like that of the stars in
          autumn, was diffused all upon the statue, and the altar, and the
          warlike trophies suspended in the inner recesses, from the sacred
          tree of silver that stands in the centre; amidst the trembling
          enamelled leaves and drooping boughs of which hung many lamps,
          after the shape and fashion of pomegranates: and out of every
          pomegranate flowed a separate gleam of that soft light, supplied
          mysteriously through the stem of the silver tree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There appeared
          presently from behind the statue, a majestic woman, arrayed in long
          white garments, and having a fillet of laurel leaves twined above
          her veil. Venerable and stately was her mien, but haughty, rather
          than serene, the aspect of her countenance. Without looking towards
          us, she went up to the altar, and began to busy herself in trimming
          the sacred fire, which, as I have said, exhibited only a lambent
          flame. When, with many kneelings and other ceremonies, she had
          accomplished this service, the priestess turned again, as if to
          depart; and then first, as it seemed, observing the presence of
          strangers, she stood still before the altar, and regarding us
          attentively, began to recognize the Lady Rubellia; whom, forthwith
          advancing, she saluted courteously, and invited to come with the
          rest of us into her privacy, behind the shrine of the God.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She led the way,
          Rubellia and the rest of us in her train, through several
          folding-doors, and along many narrow passages all inlaid, on roof,
          wall, and floor, with snow-white alabaster and rich mosaic work;
          until at length we came to a little airy chamber, where three
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name=
          "Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>young maidens were
          sitting with their embroidering cushions, while one, taller than
          the rest, whose back was placed towards us, knelt on the floor,
          touching, with slow fingers, the strings of a Dorian lyre. Hearing
          the sound of her music as we entered, we stood still in the
          door-way, and the priestess, willing apparently that our approach
          should remain unknown, advancing a step or two before us, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sing on—I have trimmed the flame; but
          remember, I pray you, that the precincts of Phœbus are not those of
          Pluto, and let not your chant be of such funereal solemnity. We
          solitaries have little need of depressing numbers.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dear friend,”</span> replied she that had been thus
          addressed, without changing her attitude, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you must bear with my numbers such as they are; for if
          you bid me sing only merry strains, I am afraid neither voice nor
          fingers may be able well to obey you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These words were
          spoken in a low and melancholy voice, which I well recognized.
          Sextus, also, perceived who spoke; but when he looked at me to
          signify this, I motioned to keep silence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Then please yourself,”</span> said the priestess,
          laying her hand on Athanasia’s shoulders; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“but do sing, for I should fain have my maidens to hear
          something truly of your music.”</span> With that she again applied
          her fingers to the lyre, and stooping over it, began to play some
          notes of prelude, less sorrowful than what we had at first heard.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Ay, my dear girl,”</span> says the
          priestess, <span class="tei tei-q">“you could not have chosen
          better. Heavens! how many lordly choirs have I heard singing to
          that old Delian air. There are a hundred hymns that may be sung to
          it—give us whichsoever of them pleases your <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fancy the best.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I will try,”</span> replied the maiden, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to sing the words you have heard before. If I
          remember, you liked them.”</span> Then boldly at once, yet gently,
          did her voice rush into the current of that ancient strain that you
          have heard so often; but it was then that I myself for the first
          time heard it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But as they were
          singing the last verse of all, Rubellia also aided their melody
          with a rich strong gushing voice, which rose far above all the
          others; and the silent Athanasia turning round quickly, perceived,
          not without manifestation of alarm, by how many strangers her song
          had been overheard. On seeing who we were, she saluted Sextus and
          myself with modest courtesy, amidst her confusion; and it may be
          that my companion, as well as myself, blushed at the same moment;
          for he could not see Athanasia without thinking of Sempronia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seemed as if
          her confusion were not unconnected with some suspicion of having
          been recognized near the Prætorian guard-house; for, after the
          first glance, I in vain endeavoured to meet her eye; while on the
          contrary, to Sextus she directed both looks and words, enough to
          provoke visibly some not altogether benign movements in our
          Rubellia. Such, at least, was my interpretation of the fair widow’s
          aspect, and the tone of impatience in which she, after a minute or
          two had passed, began to urge the propriety of our proceeding to
          the part of the imperial edifice in which the painter was expecting
          us.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priestess of
          Apollo hearing her say so, courteously offered to guide us beyond
          the precincts of the temple, and our whole party were again in
          motion; but Athanasia remained behind with the three young damsels,
          and I, who walked last, saw her, ere the portal received me,
          preparing again to handle the lyre, with fingers visibly trembling,
          and a pale countenance, not as I thought unstained with some yet
          more distinct traces of keen emotion. The sight of her agitation
          fixed my footstep for a moment, and it was then that, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on her casting a sudden glance round to
          the place where I stood, I perceived truly that I had not been
          mistaken, and that the tears were gathered within her eyelids. It
          was no more, however, than one glance, for immediately she stooped
          again, and, dashing her fingers along the chords of the instrument,
          appeared to bury her thoughts in its harmony. I stood for a moment,
          and then ashamed of myself, and troubled with her troubles and with
          my own, I followed the rest into the great library which Augustus
          placed beneath the protection of the Palatine Apollo. The priestess
          parted from us at its entrance, after pointing out a low and
          massive door of bronze on the right hand, within which, as she told
          me, the remains of the Sybilline prophecies are preserved, unseen
          by profane eyes, watched over perpetually by the guardians of the
          place.</p>

          III.</span></span></h1>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had walked by
          the side of my young friend, and behind the Stoic, (who, I think,
          was expressing, in his pompous fashion, much admiration of the
          singing of Rubellia,) along one or two of the great halls in which
          the library is contained, before the novelty of the objects
          surrounding me made any impression even on my eyes; and even after
          these were in some measure engaged, my mind still continued to
          dwell on that troubled aspect, and on the notes of the uncompleted
          song. At length, however, the levity of youth, and natural
          curiosity revived; and I began to be present, not in body merely,
          in a place where there was much that might well interest the mind.
          Far-receding rows of columns conducted my eyes into the
          interminable recesses of that wide range of chambers, in which the
          records of the thought and spirit of all past ages are piled up
          together; and gazing on the loaded shelves which every where
          ascended into the galleries, I could not but be affected with many
          new emotions. I perused glorious names on the busts that seemed to
          preside over the different compartments. The high filletted front
          of Homer detained for the first time my contemplation; the eyes of
          the divine old man, even in sculpture, distinctly <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and visibly blind, while the serenity
          and sanctity of the towering forehead, revealed how the intense
          perception at once of the lovely and the great could compensate for
          visions of earthly beauty shut out. The mild Plato, and the
          imperious Stagyrite—Pindar—Simonides—Alcæus—and I know not how many
          more, succeeded as we passed along—each in his own sphere, reigning
          by himself; yet all connected together by a certain common air of
          greatness, like so many successive princes, or contemporary heroes
          of the same mighty empire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this main
          range, there diverged many lesser chambers, in which we saw
          studious persons engaged, each seated by himself, and having his
          eyes fixed on the parchment before him. Of these, some deigned not
          to intimate by the smallest movement their perception that any one
          had approached; but with others Xerophrastes exchanged, as he
          walked, lofty salutation, and one or two even entered, for a
          moment, into conversation with him. With one of these, indeed, (an
          ancient of bitter aspect,) to such a length did the colloquy
          extend, that we began to think we should never be able to get our
          Stoic away from him; till, as our fortune would have it, it became
          necessary for them to have a certain book for the purpose of
          reference, and then Xerophrastes began to make inquiries concerning
          Parmeno, who, as I gathered, must needs be one of those intrusted
          with the care of the library.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am afraid,”</span> said the other, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“if we must wait for him, we shall not be able to get
          that work either to-day or to-morrow; for his pupil, the son of
          Fabricius, is dead, and I suppose he will now change his quarters,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name=
          "Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and be no longer seen
          so often about these haunts of the muses.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> interrupted Sextus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I met Fabricius in the Forum a few days ago, and he
          told me his son was ill; but little did I imagine my dear companion
          was so near his end! Is it indeed so?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Even so,”</span> rejoined the other. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Rapid have been the shears of Atropos! It is but a few
          moments since Agaso, the painter passed; and, he told me he had
          been receiving orders to take a likeness, as well as he could, from
          the corpse.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If Agaso be so engaged,”</span> replied Xerophrastes,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid we need not expect to find him
          neither in his usual place. Perhaps we had better make inquiry for
          him at the dwelling of Fabricius.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this Sextus
          assented; or rather, being lost in reflection concerning the death
          of his friend, he suffered himself to be conducted by the Stoic.
          Passing, therefore, through one or two more apartments, we issued
          forth, and drew near to the vestibule of Fabricius’ house, who, as
          they told me, was a noble Roman, having the chief superintendance
          of the whole library, and an intimate friend of Licinius—one whose
          domestic calamity could not fail to spread much affliction through
          a wide circle of patrician kindred.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the
          vestibule, we found assembled not a few of the young man’s
          relations; but Xerophrastes immediately said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold Parmeno, he is the most afflicted; and what
          wonder that it should be so?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> said Sextus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the bier is set forth; the last rites are to be
          performed this evening.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Parmeno was
          a striking figure. Seated close <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>by the bier, his head was involved in his
          cloak, so that only his eyes and his nose could be seen, but these
          of themselves expressed a decorous affliction; and the folds of the
          cloak fell down over the rest of his person in great order and
          dignity. On the pavement beside him was seen lying, half-unfolded,
          a book inscribed with the name of Heraclitus, which he appeared to
          have been reading. When Xerophrastes approached, this mourner
          stretched forth his hand, and shook his head, but he did not say
          any thing, nor even look towards the rest of us; and indeed to have
          done so, would have disturbed the attitude in which he had placed
          himself. Xerophrastes, on his part, received the proffered hand,
          and shaking his head in response, said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes, my Ionian friend, I may still bid thee hail and
          live; but I must say farewell to the plant thou wast rearing.
          Farewell to the youthful promise of Fabricius!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On hearing these
          words, the sitting philosopher drew his mantle quite over his face,
          and leant himself heavily against one of the fluted columns of the
          vestibule, for he seemed to be much shaken. In the meantime Sextus
          approached the bier, and contemplated his companion as he lay there
          wreathed with melancholy garlands; his countenance bearing a
          natural mixture of sadness and astonishment. Nor could I, who had
          never before seen the young man, behold the spectacle without
          similar emotions; for his age, as it seemed, could not have been
          much different from my own, and the pale features were interesting,
          their expression not less amiable than solemn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> said Sextus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the last time I saw him, how <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>differently did he appear! We rode out
          together with some others to Tibur, and spent all the day there;
          and as we returned by the moonlight, how joyous his conversation!
          Methinks I yet hear him laughing and speaking. We parted at the
          foot of the Capitoline, and never did I see him again till
          now.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, fate of man!”</span> quoth Xerophrastes;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“how uncertain is life, how certain death!
          Without doubt, young Fabricius had as little thought of dying as
          any of your company; and yet, see now, he is arrayed for the last
          time, and this juvenile gown, which he should so soon have laid
          aside for the manly, is destined to be consumed with
          him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A fine lad he was,”</span> cries one of the standers
          by,—<span class="tei tei-q">“a fine lad, and an excellent horseman.
          The Martian Field did not often behold such a rider in these
          degenerate days of the Roman youth.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
          rest were still contemplating the bier, Xerophrastes, turning to
          his brother philosopher, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell me
          now, my learned friend, do you still, after this mournful event,
          continue to reside with the elder Fabricius? Has that excellent man
          any more sons to be educated, or will he retain you only for the
          sake of the library, with which assuredly he will find few so
          conversant as yourself?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To which Parmeno
          replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Your question, O Xerophrastes,
          shews that clear judgment concerning the affairs of men, for which
          you have always been celebrated. No, my friend, the gray-haired
          Fabricius no longer requires my residence here; for he is about to
          retire into one of his villas on the Campanian shore, and to bury
          for ever his affliction in the privacy of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>his woods. We are about to part, not without
          mutual tears; and several Patricians have already been applying to
          him for his influence with me, whom, although unworthy of so much
          research, they earnestly covet, and wish to engage as the
          instructor of their young men. I have been sitting here not unseen,
          beside this my former charge, and each is impatient to solicit me
          into his service.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Your reputation I well know is high,”</span> replied
          Xerophrastes, <span class="tei tei-q">“and deservedly so; more
          particularly, for that fine talent you have for giving metaphysical
          interpretations of mythology, and for explaining the obscure
          allegories of ancient poets. But for my own part, Parmeno, I find
          not so much delight in abstract ideas, or in the passive
          contemplation of the universe; but incline rather to study, as
          heretofore, that part of philosophy which relates to action, and
          the morality of duty.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes, worthy Xerophrastes,”</span> returned he, with a
          most languid serenity; <span class="tei tei-q">“and so far as I
          understand, you sort well in this with the stirring disposition of
          your friend Licinius.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To which
          Xerophrastes made answer:—<span class="tei tei-q">“My patron
          Licinius is fond of action, and I of the rules of action. He says,
          it is only in war, or in civil functions of a public nature, that a
          person can prove himself a man. The rest, he says, is visionary,
          and comes to nothing, or is a slumber of the mind in sensuality,
          without thought.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Does he think, then,”</span> quoth Parmeno, his
          wobegone countenance relaxing into a smile,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Does Licinius think, then, there is no sensuality in
          perpetual action, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg
          182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and declamation and noise? To me such things
          appear almost as trivial as the lazy enjoyments of Epicureans,
          besides being harsh and disagreeable, and not unfrequently
          ridiculous. But observe, O Xerophrastes! that I speak these things
          as it were abstractly, and not by any means in disparagement of
          Licinius, your excellent patron and friend.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To which the
          stoic replied in astonishment—<span class="tei tei-q">“What is this
          you have said? Do you assert that action is sensual?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then Parmeno,
          lifting from the pavement the book which he had been reading, or
          appearing to read, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is even so,
          most erudite Xerophrastes. Indeed, I have always delighted in the
          most primitive and remote doctrines handed down from antiquity; and
          among others, in the riddles of this obscure Ephesian. Following
          the scope of his philosophy, I am led to believe, that, so often as
          the mind impels, or is impelled by other causes, it begins to lose
          sight of pure knowledge, and becomes in danger of thinking that
          every thing is vain, light, and evanescent, except what is
          perceived by the senses. Heraclitus well says, that Love and Hatred
          govern all things. Now, when the principle of Discord prevails, it
          subjects all things to the dominion of action, and to the gross
          perceptions of sense. But when that of Love is prevalent, it
          emancipates the struggling chaos of things from the yearning of
          compulsion, and from the darkness of sensual proximity; for,
          between things that struggle immediately against each other, light
          has no room to enter in and shine; and therefore it is, that, when
          Love gains the ascendency, a new arrangement is produced—an
          arrangement which, if I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg
          183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>may so express it, is more serene,
          transparent, orderly and divine, and wherein things exist in safety
          from the danger of mutual destruction.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a
          preliminary cough:—<span class="tei tei-q">“My opinion,”</span>
          replied Xerophrastes, <span class="tei tei-q">“coincides rather
          with that of Empedocles. The immortal Sicilian thinks that Discord
          is the only separating and arranging principle which marks the
          boundaries between things, and enables them mutually to act and
          repel, in such a way as to preserve order.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay, nay,”</span> interrupted Parmeno, his hands being
          by this quite disentangled from his cloak, and his countenance
          lighted up,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, nay, to such doctrine I
          never shall assent. From Empedocles—even from Xerophrastes, I must
          differ for ever on this head. The order of which you and the
          Sicilian speak, is the order of darkness only, and of blind
          force,—a kind of order in which fierceness and cruelty always
          reign.”</span> But Xerophrastes continued:—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And I farther concur with Empedocles in thinking, that
          Love is a principle of which the predominance is more fit to turn
          order into a chaos, than to produce the effects you have
          described.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Nay, speak not against
          Love,”</span> quoth Parmeno—<span class="tei tei-q">“Speak not
          against Love, nor believe that any respect is due to the dictates
          of Empedocles, who taught the worst that can be taught by any
          man—that is to say, the alternation of order and confusion
          succeeding each other throughout all time. To seek for truth in
          conceptions like these, is no better than to seek repose in the
          bosom of Ætna.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“In reference to
          that point,”</span> resumed Xerophrastes, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I agree with you in your disapprobation of Empedocles.
          But when you say, that Love is the source of knowledge, you
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name=
          "Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>much astonish me; for
          I have always thought rather that its tendency is to bring
          confusion upon the mind.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Once more,”</span> said Parmeno—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“once more, let me beseech you to say nothing against
          love. You are thinking of the love of particular objects. You speak
          of Cupid, and not of that heavenly Eros, who, so far from
          enchaining, or tyrannizing over the mind, rather enables it to
          escape into the tranquil freedom of far extended contemplation. But
          what is contemplation without the knowledge of permanent forms, on
          which the mind may find repose, and so keep itself from being
          perplexed by the shifting aspects of the many-coloured universe?
          And therefore it is, O Xerophrastes, that, sometimes laying aside
          Heraclitus, I study the ancient verses of the poet, Xenophanes, who
          shews, by the nature of abstract forms, that a certain unity
          pervades all things. Xenophanes mused of old at Colophon, looking
          through the blue ether of my native Ionia.—But why should I speak
          thus at length? Alas! what is the occasion of our being here!—I
          perceive the approach of the poet, who was to compose an
          inscription for the urn of my dear Fabricius. Yonder also is the
          architect, who comes with a design for the tomb. Oh! day of wo,
          that I should sit in judgment concerning the epitaph and tomb of my
          ingenuous youth!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is, indeed, true,”</span> replied Xerophrastes,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that even I, in the repercussions of our
          talk, had well-nigh forgotten this unhappy occurrence; but,
          perhaps, there is something not after all entirely excusable in our
          giving so much superiority to the affairs of philosophical
          discussion. Now, however, it is evident, that we must suspend our
          colloquy—And who, I beseech you, above <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>all things, is he that now draws near to the
          place of this mournful assembly, holding a horse in his hand.
          Methinks I have seen his face before.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“That you have indeed, Master,”</span> quoth he that
          had come up,—<span class="tei tei-q">“that you have; and no longer
          ago than yesterday neither, if you will be pleased to give yourself
          the trouble of recollecting. My name is Aspar—I am well known. If
          but my excellent friend, the noble Centurion Sabinus, were here,
          poor old Aspar would have no reason to complain of the want of a
          good word.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Good morrow to you, Aspar,”</span> said Sextus;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“but what is it that brings you hither just
          at this moment? And for what purpose have you brought your horse
          with you? for people of your sort do not in general ride in the
          courts of the Palatine.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> quoth Aspar, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and is it you, who seem to have been one of the
          contemporaries of that peerless youth—is it you that ask such a
          question as this? I did not, in truth, imagine that there was any
          friend of young Fabricius, who did not know his affection for
          little Sora. There is not such another within twenty miles of the
          Capitol; but I brought her hither merely out of regard for the
          family. As for myself, I should never bear to look on her again
          with pleasure, after knowing the sudden manner of his death. I wish
          to Heaven the filly were fairly lodged in one of the paddocks of
          the Lord Fabricius himself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lead the animal round into the stables,”</span> says
          Parmeno, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I doubt not care will be
          taken of her.—Yonder comes one of the buffoons of the theatre;—he,
          I doubt not, is here to disgrace, if he be permitted, this solemn
          scene, with ranting quotations from the tragic <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>poets. Alas! alas! I cannot bear all
          this: There also advance the officiators from the Temple of
          Libitina; they have their cypress boughs ready in their hands. Oh,
          my learned friend, I cannot sustain these things; let me be gone
          into the mansion.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The admirer of
          Heraclitus, picking up his scroll, and gathering together the folds
          of his mantle, moved slowly into the house, Xerophrastes following
          with similar gestures. Sextus and I also were about to take our
          departure; and he, having procured from one of the slaves of the
          house a myrtle garland, had already placed it upon the bier of the
          young Fabricius, as the last testimonial of his concern; when there
          drew near two young men, clad in long mantles of black, who,
          solemnly embracing my friend, began to exchange with him many
          expressions of grief.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While they were
          thus engaged, Rubellia, who had been standing all this while a
          little apart, sent a boy to inform us that the painter we were in
          search of had at last made his appearance, and was anxious to
          proceed with his portrait. I drew Sextus away, therefore, and soon
          joined the lady and the artist; but as we were moving off thus, one
          of the bystanding slaves, an old gray-headed man, came up and
          whispered to Sextus, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir, be not deceived;
          these two nephews of my bereaved master are to me the most
          disagreeable part of all this preparation. You have heard their
          lamentation, and seen their sweeping raiment of mourning; but, be
          sure, a principal subject of their reflection is the probability
          that one or other of them must be adopted by Fabricius. Alas! alas!
          so goes all between Lucina and Libitina. There was never a birth
          nor a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name=
          "Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>marriage that did not
          create some sorrow, nor a funeral procession that did not give rise
          to some joy. Your rhetoricians talk, but what avails it all? Slaves
          and masters are alike subjected to the evils of the world, and of
          these death is both the last and the least.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Agaso, the
          painter, was a smart dapper little bandy-legged man of Verona,
          dressed in a Grecian mantle, and endeavouring to look as much as
          possible like a Greek. Had Xerophrastes not gone off with his
          brother of Ionia, I have no doubt this man would have made his
          presence a sufficient excuse for speaking nothing but Greek to us;
          but, even as it was, his conversation was interlarded with an
          abundant intermixture of that noble tongue. Nothing could be spoken
          of which Agaso did not think fit to illustrate, either by the
          narration of something he himself had seen or heard during his
          residence at Athens, or, at least, by some quotation from the
          Grecian poets. To judge from the square, and somewhat ponderous
          formation of the man’s features, Nature had not designed him for
          any of the most mercurial specimens of her workmanship; but he
          contrived, notwithstanding, by perpetual shrugging and grimacing,
          and, above all, by keeping his eyes and eyebrows continually in
          motion, to give himself an air of no inconsiderable life and
          vivacity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hopping before
          us with much alacrity, this artist conducted our steps through
          eight or ten galleries, until at length a curtain being withdrawn,
          which had covered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg
          189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the space between two pilasters, we found
          ourselves in a spacious apartment, which, from the courteousness
          wherewith he bowed us into it, there could be no difficulty in
          perceiving to be the customary sphere of his own exertions. It was
          not altogether deserted even when we entered, but the removal of
          the curtain attracted more of the loungers of the baths, and ere
          Sextus was fairly fixed before the table of the painter, the modest
          youth had the mortification to find himself surrounded with a very
          crowd of knowing and curious physiognomies. The presence of these,
          however, appeared not unwelcome to the master. On the contrary,
          there arose between the little man, as he was preparing his
          brushes, and those who had come to survey him at his work, such a
          gabble of compliments, remarks, and disquisitions, that it seemed
          to me as if he would have been disappointed had he not been
          favoured with their attendance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Rupilius!—Heavens! with what felicity you have caught the air!
          Methinks I see him about to enter the Basilica, when he knows that
          some great cause is awaiting his decision. What solemnity in his
          aspect! what grandeur in the gown!—How finely the purple of the
          laticlave is made to harmonize with the colouring of the cheeks and
          chin! What beautiful handling about the fingers with which he
          grasps his tablets!—As for the head of the stylus, it is the very
          eye of the picture.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Exquisite
          indeed,”</span> quoth another; <span class="tei tei-q">“but who can
          look at it, or at any thing else, in the same room with this little

          Circus or the Amphitheatre. What an inimitable modesty!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The painter
          heard this last piece of eulogy with an air of some embarrassment,
          and at the same time looked very cunningly towards the person who
          had uttered it. But the Lady Rubellia tossed her head, and
          whispered to me, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pretty she may be, though
          I cannot say that style of dressing the hair is at all adapted for
          such features; but for modesty! hem. I asked Agaso two or three
          days ago who it was, and he told me—guess!—it is a little Spanish
          girl, whom that august-looking person, with the grand laticlave,
          and the purple cheeks and chin, and the glittering stylus, thought
          fit to bring home with him when he was relieved from the hard
          duties of the Pro-prætorship. I dare say, he takes care she shall
          not be seen either at Circus or Amphitheatre; and, indeed, I think
          it is sufficient impudence to shew her likeness in the company of
          so many portraits of respectability.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My dear lady,”</span> quoth the painter, who overheard
          somewhat, <span class="tei tei-q">“for the sake of all that is
          sacred, no word of this again! Wait, at least, till the canvass for
          the Augurship be over. There are always so many to exaggerate and
          misrepresent.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Exaggerate, indeed!
          I think Rupilius ought to be ashamed of himself; and at his time of
          life too. I think you said he was just the same age with my
          uncle?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> says the
          painter, <span class="tei tei-q">“he must be of that standing; and
          I think he went to Spain just about the period of your
          marriage.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Filthy old
          fellow,”</span> quoth she, very quickly; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and this is the treasure he has brought home with him!
          I have a great mind to tell his wife.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hush, hush,”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>said Agaso, <span class="tei tei-q">“this is
          the very day Rupilius spoke of bringing her to see his own
          portrait; and, indeed, I am sure that is the Senator’s cough. I
          rely on your prudence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the portly
          original of the laticlaved portrait walked into the room, having
          his gown and every part of his dress arranged as represented in the
          picture; although in the living countenance it was easy to discover
          a few lines and spots which had been omitted in the copy. By his
          side moved a short woman, arrayed in the extremity of costly
          attire, whose swarthy complexion did not, in spite of cosmeticism,
          harmonize very well with the bright golden ringlets of her
          Sicambrian peruque; while behind the pair came a thin damsel, whose
          lineaments exhibited a sort of faint shadow of the same visage, the
          rudiments of which had been so abundantly filled up in that of the
          rubicund magistrate. The ex-pro-prætor, after saluting Agaso, stood
          still with dignity in the midst of the apartment, while the fond
          daughter, rushing close up to his picture, could with difficulty
          affix any limits to her expressions of satisfaction:—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Jupiter! look at the ring. It is the very ring he
          wears!—the very images are engraved upon it; one can see the three
          Graces. I never saw such a picture—when will it be brought
          home?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Hush, hush, now,
          Primula,”</span> quoth the mother. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
          certainly a likeness; but why will artists, now-a-days, always
          paint people older than they are? And besides, it wants something
          of his expression. Don’t you think so yourself, sir?”</span>
          (turning to the painter) <span class="tei tei-q">“Rupilius has
          surely been looking very gloomily when he
          sat.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg
          192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this the
          painter, leaving Sextus, advanced to her side, and after a pause of
          some moments, spent in contemplating alternately his own work and
          the original, said, with a courteous simper, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“How much am I indebted to you, most noble lady, for
          this visit, and these judicious remarks! I only wish you had
          accompanied the senator, for then, without question, his
          countenance would have worn the look you desiderate; and I perhaps
          might have more easily succeeded in catching it, being aided by
          your suggestions. I hope it may yet be
          amended.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“How modest he is!”</span>
          ejaculated the spouse. <span class="tei tei-q">“A single sitting
          will suffice, I am sure. We shall come some day when you are quite
          alone, and I will sit by you, and talk to Rupilius all the
          while.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Delightful!”</span> replied
          the artist; <span class="tei tei-q">“how happy shall I be in such
          an opportunity of improving both the picture and myself! We must
          positively prevail on the senator to give us this one sitting
          more.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Never ask his
          consent,”</span> quoth the matron, smiling upon her lord;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“leave the whole matter to me. The picture
          is for me. And besides, if he were to refuse, I know how I should
          be certain to overcome him; for he has asked me to sit to you
          myself, and you know if I were to persist in sitting with my gloomy
          face, as he has with his, we should soon bring him to his right
          reason.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Your</span></span>
          gloomy face, noble lady!”</span> replied the artist, strutting back
          a pace or two. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid, if that is the
          charm by which alone he is to be softened, we must give up all our
          hopes.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I protest,”</span> says the
          lady, <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe you will keep me laughing
          all the time I sit. And pray now, what dress do you think I should
          wear? Prima says, I ought certainly to be in green; <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but I was thinking, that perhaps a
          yellow byssine would suit me better. But I shall send over half a
          dozen robes, and then we can choose whichever seems to be the best.
          One thing only I am quite resolved upon, and that is, that I shall
          have my golden chain, with the miniature of the Pro-prætor—the
          Senator, I mean—at the end of it.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nothing could be in finer taste,”</span> he made
          answer; <span class="tei tei-q">“and if my lady should think of
          green, or purple, or any dark colour for the gown, the rings of the
          chain and the setting of the miniature would have the richest
          effect.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“And do, my dear
          mother,”</span> interrupted Prima; <span class="tei tei-q">“and do
          have on the sapphire tiara when you sit to Agaso. Or what would you
          think of having your own hair simply like this lady here? What a
          beauty!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“A smart little girl,
          indeed,”</span> quoth the mother. <span class="tei tei-q">“I think
          I should know that face. Is she Roman, Agaso?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, not a Roman,”</span> answered the artist;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“nor do I think my lady can ever have met
          with her. But perhaps my Lord Rupilius may, for she is a
          Spaniard.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Agaso turned
          with a smile to the Senator; but he, scarcely appearing to look at
          the picture, answered, with great gravity, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I think I have seen the countenance before; and
          perhaps it was in my province. The face is certainly a pretty one;
          but nothing so very extraordinary.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They may say what they like,”</span> observed the
          spouse, drawing herself up; <span class="tei tei-q">“but there is
          no such thing as a really urbane air to be got out of
          Rome.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime, in
          another part of the room, some other picture appeared to be
          exciting a scarcely inferior measure of curiosity. On approaching
          the party, I perceived that this was a sketch, in chalk only, of
          the head <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg
          194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and shoulders of an old man; and when I had
          gained an opportunity of more nearly surveying it, I recognized
          without difficulty the features of Tisias of Antioch. The greater
          number of those who were looking on it, seemed also to have been
          present at his death; for I heard pointed out by them with
          exactness the parts in which the resemblance had been most
          successfully taken. The beauty of the old man’s lineaments, and the
          serenity of his aspect, they all admired; and while they were loud
          in praising these, Agaso himself also joined them, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, so you have found out my old
          Christian! How did you get hold of him? for I meant it not to be
          seen till I had lain on a little of the colour. But is it not a
          fine study?—is it not a noble head? I think I shall introduce it in
          the picture I am painting for Pliny. The subject is the sacrifice
          of Iphigenia. I went to the Amphitheatre,”</span> he continued,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“rather late, without expecting any thing
          particular; but it immediately struck me that he might be turned to
          some account. I made several little sketches of him, for it was a
          long time ere it was over; and this is from the one I took just
          after he had made his oration. His hands and feet were singularly
          fine, I thought. Here,”</span> said he, turning over the leaves of
          his tablets—<span class="tei tei-q">“here you have him in a variety
          of shapes!—the muscles shewed powerfully when he knelt;—there,
          again, you have his fingers as they were folded on his breast—not
          much flesh, but the lines good—veins well expressed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But about this
          time the great bell rung in the tower above the Baths, and the
          greater part of the young loungers soon dispersed themselves; some
          to fence or wrestle—others to play in the tennis-court—others to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name=
          "Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ride in the
          Hippodrome, in preparation for the bath. So Agaso, being left alone
          with Sextus, Rubellia, and myself, had at length leisure to proceed
          with his portrait of the youth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much did the
          lady and the painter discourse, and many merry things were said by
          them both; but all they said could not entirely remove the
          embarrassment fixed on the countenance of Sextus; nor, of a truth,
          did he present himself with much advantage before the artist.
          Rubellia, nevertheless, sate over against him with looks of no
          severe criticism; and I doubt not she would have remained to the
          end of the sitting, had not one of her household come with a
          message, which, as it seemed, rendered necessary her departure. It
          struck me, that the messenger answered very well to Dromo’s
          description of the fat Calabrian with whom he and Boto had been
          drinking; but of this I said nothing to Sextus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was near the
          hour of supper before we were dismissed, and we found Licinius
          already about to enter his eating chamber.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The orator
          received us with less coldness than I could have expected. I
          suppose his knowledge that our morning had been spent in Rubellia’s
          company, had in some measure softened his feelings of jealousy
          towards his son; and perhaps he had given me credit for advice, to
          the merit of which I had no claim. But he remained not long at
          table after supper was concluded, being summoned to discourse in
          private with a client:—so that Sextus and I were left to spend the
          evening as it might please ourselves; for as to Xerophrastes, he
          had not as yet made his appearance, and we took it for granted he
          had remained at the mansion of Fabricius, for the purpose of
          consoling with philosophical controversies his bereaved brother of
          Ionia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We retired,
          therefore, into the apartment of my young friend; but he could not
          read a page without coming upon some verse which made him throw
          down the scroll to ruminate on the charms of his Sempronia. When he
          took up his lute, his fingers seemed to evoke only the most
          melancholy sounds. It was only in the exercise of the foil, that he
          succeeded in banishing from his thoughts the troubles of his
          situation; but both of us having contended till <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>we were breathless, were soon compelled
          to sit down, and then the unhappy boy’s exhausted body seemed to
          communicate a new debility to his mind. We sat for the most part in
          silence, (for I soon found that I could not say any thing capable
          of interesting him,) until the shades of evening had quite darkened
          the chamber, and then we walked together, not less silently, in the
          adjoining open gallery, until the moon had arisen from above the
          tall poplars around the Pantheon and Baths of Agrippa, and diffused
          her radiance over all the beautiful gardens and noble edifices that
          lay beneath us down to the brink of the river. Lassitude of spirit
          then, if not expectation of sleep, rendered Sextus desirous of
          retiring to his couch; so, having exhorted the youth to wrestle
          with his grief, and to call hope to his aid, I at length left him
          to himself. But as for me, I had as yet no feeling of weariness,
          and, besides, I remembered the promise I had made to Dromo in the
          morning.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was very much
          surprised, indeed, that the Cretan had not as yet come to me, and
          made inquiry concerning him of Boto; but hearing that the man was
          absent from the house, I thought from this there was the more
          likelihood of his being engaged in some scheme, the result of which
          I should by and by learn from his own lips. I dismissed my Briton,
          therefore, and prepared to read by my watch-light, and while I was
          considering what I should read, I remembered the scroll I had
          received from Tisias, which forthwith I took from the place in
          which I had locked it up on the morning of the preceding day. There
          fell from out of it, as I unfolded it, a letter sealed, but without
          any superscription. This I of course considered as meant only
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name=
          "Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for the eye of
          Athanasia; so I kissed the parchment her fingers were destined to
          touch, and, before I began to read, restored it to its
          receptacle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More than one of
          you, my young friends, have already heard me speak, on another
          occasion, of the impression which that night’s reading made upon my
          mind, and been told, from my own lips, what book it was that was
          contained in the scroll of Tisias; the rest of you will judge for
          yourselves with what astonishment it was that I, who had at the
          best expected to unfold some obscure treatise of Asiatic lore, some
          semi-barbarous exposition of mystical riddles, found myself engaged
          in the perusal of a plain and perspicuous narrative of facts,
          written evidently by a man of accomplishment and learning, and in
          Greek of which the most elegant penman of these times could have
          had no occasion to be ashamed. In a word, it was the Gospel of the
          holy physician St Luke which had been put into my hands; and at
          this day I am still grateful that this was the first of the
          Christian books which I had an opportunity of seeing; for such had
          been my education, that I am afraid others, not less worthy of the
          true faith, might have repelled me by the peculiarities of their
          composition, as well as by the acquaintance with many things, to me
          then entirely unknown, which they take for granted in the style of
          their commencement. Here, however, there was enough only of
          mystery, the more effectually to stimulate my curiosity, while the
          eagerness with which I engaged myself in its gratification, was
          abundantly repaid from the beginning, both by the beauty of the
          simple narrative itself, and the sublimity of the conceptions
          embodied and evolved in its course.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Considering the
          book which I was reading, as one merely of human origin and
          invention, I could not help regarding it with such admiration, that
          it appeared to me above all things wonderful, I had never seen it
          mentioned by any of the writers of the age, or heard it spoken of
          by any of those who, in my presence, since I came to Rome, had
          talked concerning the faith and doctrines of the persecuted
          Christians. But this was not all. At least, said I to myself, there
          is something here which deserves to be inquired into and examined.
          Of things such as these, if told falsely, it must needs have
          been—nay, it must still be, easy to prove the falsehood. It is
          impossible that, in the days of Tiberius, any such events should
          have occurred in Palestine, without being more or less submitted to
          the inspection of Roman eyes. This is no wild tale, handed down
          from the dark ages of a barbarous race. Here I have a Roman
          Centurion described as among the witnesses of this man’s miraculous
          power, and acknowledging the divinity of his benevolence. Here, at
          least, must have been one spectator without prejudices, otherwise
          than against this Prophet of Nazareth. Of a surety, the legends of
          Rome herself contain many tales which demand a much greater measure
          of indulgence; since the wonders they narrate appear to have been
          oftentimes attended with no beneficial consequences, either to
          individuals or to the state; whereas here the occasion seems always
          to have been such as might justify the interference of supernatural
          might. The power of this person seems to have been exerted only for
          good; and his precepts are full of such godlike loftiness as
          neither Socrates, nor Plato, nor any of those Greek sages, who
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name=
          "Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>bowed in reverence to
          the hoary wisdom of Egypt and India, would have disdained to
          admire.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doubts,
          suspicions, and distrusts, with which such thoughts were
          mingled,—the under-current of reluctance with which I felt myself
          all along contending,—were such as you may more easily imagine than
          I can describe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the narrative
          went on, however, you will have no difficulty in supposing that my
          attention became more and more rivetted, and that, occupied with
          the strange events and sublime scenes it unfolds—and agitated by
          turns with the pity, the wonder, the terror, and the admiration
          that matchless story must ever awaken,—I had forgotten every thing
          beyond the page of the volume on which my finger was fixed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was only the
          rustling of Dromo’s cloak against the edge of my chair, that made
          me aware my privacy was disturbed. His hands seemed to be busied in
          tightening his girdle even before he was able to speak, and the
          first words he uttered, were—<span class="tei tei-q">“Come,
          sir—this is no time for study. I have acquaintance with some of the
          soldiers at the Capene Gate, and they will let us pass through; but
          they are relieved at the next watch, and then we shall have no
          chance.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“And why,”</span> said I,
          hastily thrusting the scroll into my bosom—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“why, Dromo, or for what purpose should we desire to
          pass through the Capene Gate at the dead hour of
          night?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Come,”</span> said he;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“there is no time for explanation. It is
          simply because it is the dead hour of night that we must pass
          through the gate; for it would do nobody any good to pass through
          at any other time. Come—or abandon Sextus to his
          fate.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg
          201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus adjured, I
          could not oppose any obstacle to his zeal. The chained porter was
          lying asleep across the threshold; but Dromo had already found
          means to have the door opened, so he leaped lightly over the man,
          and I imitated his agility. The Cretan then locked the gate on the
          outside, by means of a key which he carried in his bosom; and I
          followed his rapid steps without farther question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This cunning
          varlet, (who seemed, indeed, to move as if he had a natural
          aversion to every open place,) threaded one obscure lane after
          another, keeping always, where the moonlight had any access, to the
          dark side of the way; a person better skilled than myself might
          well have been somewhat puzzled; as for me, I had not the least
          conception whither I was going. Close, however, did I adhere to
          him; and we reached the Capene Port, which is on the south side of
          the city, not many bow-shots from the Anio, before I could have
          imagined it possible to traverse so great a space.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here Dromo told
          me to wait for him a single moment, and stepped down into a cellar,
          in which a light was burning; but he staid not long, and when he
          returned to me, I observed that his style of walking was more
          clumsy than usual, which, indeed, was not to be wondered at,
          considering that he had now to carry, not only himself, but two
          huge skins of wine, intended, as I at once suspected, for the
          purpose of facilitating our passage. I told him my suspicion in a
          whisper; but he made no answer, except by handing to me one of his
          burdens. So laden, we crept on as well as we could to the portal,
          beneath the shadow of which two Prætorians were pacing, their
          armour ringing audibly upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>them amidst the silence of the night.—Silently
          did the well-oiled hinges turn, and very silently stooping did we
          step beneath the lintel of the Capene Gate, which as silently was
          again made fast.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we advanced
          among the funereal monuments which line the Appian Way on either
          side, Dromo stood still every now and then for a moment, as if to
          listen; but whatever he might have heard, or expected to hear, I
          perceived nothing, except here and there the howl of a dog, or the
          lazy hooting of the night-owl, from the top of some of the old
          cypresses that rose between us and the moon.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last he
          seemed to catch the sound he had been expecting, for he started
          suddenly; and laying his finger on his lip, crept to the
          parapet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ground
          behind was more desolate of aspect than any part of that which we
          had traversed—stoney and hard, with here and there tufts of
          withered fern; and immediately below the wall two human figures
          were visible. The one was sitting on the ground, wrapped in a dark
          cloak which entirely concealed the countenance: the other was a
          half-naked boy, holding in a string a little new-shorn lamb, which
          with one of his hands he continually caressed. But forthwith the
          sitter arose, and throwing away the cloak, displayed the gray
          tangled tresses of an old woman, and two strong boney arms, one of
          which was stretched forth with an impatient gesture towards the
          stripling, while the other was pointed upwards to the visible moon.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Strike,”</span> said she, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“strike deeply—beware lest the blood tinge your feet or
          your hands;”</span>—and I recognized at once the voice of the same
          Pona that had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg
          203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>attracted my notice in the morning, at the
          foot of the Palatine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boy drew
          forth instantly a knife from his bosom, whose glittering blade was
          buried in the throat of the yearling, and it was then first that I
          perceived a small ditch dug between the boy and the woman, into
          which, the lamb’s throat being held over it, the blood was made to
          drop from the wound. So surely had the blow been given, that not
          one bleat escaped from the animal, and so deeply, that the blood
          flowed in a strong stream, dashing audibly upon the bottom of the
          trench. And while it was dropping, the old woman muttering a sort
          of chant to Hecate, as I gathered, showered from her girdle I know
          not what of bones or sticks, mingled with leaves and roots, which
          afterwards she seemed to be stirring about in the blood with one of
          the tall strong stems of the fern that grew there. The wildness of
          her gestures was such, that I could not doubt she had herself some
          faith in the efficacy of the foul charms to which she had resorted;
          nor could I see her stirring that trench of innocent blood, without
          remembering the still more ruthless charms, whose practice the
          poets of Italy have ascribed to such hoary enchantresses. The
          dreariness of the midnight wind, too, as it whistled along the bare
          and steril soil around us, and the perpetual variations in the
          light, by reason of the careering of those innumerable clouds, and
          the remembrance of the funereal purposes for which, as it seemed,
          all this region was set apart—the whole of this together produced,
          I know not how, a certain pressure upon my spirits, and I confess
          to you, I felt, kneeling there by the side of my now trembling
          Cretan, as if I owed him no <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>great thanks for having brought me that night
          beyond the Capene Gate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seemed as if
          the goddess, to whom the witch’s song had been addressed, did not
          listen to it with favourable ear; for the clouds gathered
          themselves more thickly than ever, while the wind howled only more
          loudly among the tombs, and the half-scared owl sent up a feebler
          hooting. Notwithstanding, the old woman continued fixed in the same
          attitude of expectation, and the stripling still held the well-nigh
          drained throat of his lamb above the trench. By degrees, however,
          the patience of both seemed to be exhausted; and there arose
          between them an angry altercation. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Infernal brat of Hades!”</span> quoth the witch,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“look ye, if you have not stained your
          filthy hands, and if the thirsty shadows be not incensed, because
          you have deprived them of some of the sweet blood which they
          love!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Curse not me,
          mother,”</span> replied the boy—<span class="tei tei-q">“Did you
          think, in truth, that the blood of a stolen lamb would ever
          propitiate Hecate?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Imp!”</span>
          quoth she, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hold thy peace, or I will try
          whether no other blood may make the charm work
          better!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Beware!”</span> quoth the
          boy, leaping backwards—<span class="tei tei-q">“beware what you do!
          I am no longer so weak that I must bear all your blows.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Stop,”</span> cried I, <span class="tei tei-q">“for
          there are eyes that you think not of, to take note of your
          wickedness;”</span> and in my vehemence I shook one of the great
          loose stones that were on the top of the wall, which rolled down
          and bounded into the ditch beside them; and the woman, huddling her
          cloak over her head, began to run swiftly away from us, along the
          wall over which we were leaning. The boy only stood still for a
          moment, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg
          205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>looked upwards towards the place where we
          were, and then he also fled, but in the opposite direction; and
          Dromo said to me in a very piteous whisper, but not till both were
          out of sight,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven and earth! was ever
          such madness as to scare the witch from her incantation? Alas! for
          you and for me, sir—and, most of all, alas for Sextus—for I fear me
          after this we shall have no luck in counteracting the designs of
          Rubellia.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Rubellia! what? can you possibly imagine Rubellia to
          have any thing to do with this madness?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Imagine?”</span> quoth he; <span class="tei tei-q">“do
          you need to be told, that if things had gone well with that woman
          and her ditch, we should never have been able to preserve Sextus
          from her clutches?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the rod of Hermes, good Dromo!”</span> said I,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“this will never do. I shall believe much
          on your credit, but not things quite so extravagant as
          this.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He made no reply
          save a long, incredulous, and, I think, contemptuous whistle, which
          seemed to reach the ears of every owl between us and the Appian;
          with such a hooting and screeching did they echo its note from
          every cypress. And when Dromo heard that doleful concert, his dread
          redoubled within him, for he shook from head to foot, while I held
          his arm in mine; until, at last, he seemed to make one violent
          effort, and springing on his feet, said—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come, Master Valerius, let us behave after all like
          men!”</span>—I smiled when he said so—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
          hour has not yet come, if my Calabrian friend is to be trusted, at
          which the lady was to visit Pona in her dwelling. It is but daring
          a little more. If she has seen and known us already, then nothing
          can endanger us farther; and if she hath not, we may <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>escape again.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well spoken,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“most shrewd Dromo, and like yourself; but what is it
          that you would have us to do?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
          first thing,”</span> he replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“is what
          has already been too long delayed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Cretan
          produced from under his cloak a long fictitious beard, which he
          immediately proceeded to fix upon his own face with a string. A
          thin tall cap of black cloth was next brought forth, which he
          fastened in like manner around his brows; and a little piece of
          chalk, with which he once or twice rubbed over his black bushy
          eye-brows, completed a disguise beneath which I should certainly
          have sought in vain to discover any trace of the natural
          countenance of Dromo. In short, after a few changes in the folding
          of his cloak, there stood before me a figure so venerably
          mysterious, that had I met it unawares at midnight, in the
          neighbourhood of so many tombs, I am not sure, although of no
          superstitious temper, that I could have regarded it without
          awe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come now, good Master,”</span> quoth he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you are taller than I, pluck me a branch from the
          nearest tree, and I think you shall confess I make a decent
          Soothsayer.”</span> In this it was easy to gratify him; for there
          was an old willow just a few yards off, and its boughs were so dry
          with age, that I soon abstracted a very proper wand for him. After
          receiving which, he stood for a moment leaning on it in a dignified
          fashion, as if to rehearse an attitude worthy of his new vocation;
          and then said—<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, sir, I think if the
          Lady Rubellia comes now, we shall be tolerably prepared for her.
          But I have no disguise for you; therefore, the moment you hear a
          footstep, be sure you wrap your <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>face in your gown, and stand behind me, for so
          shall you best consult both your own concealment, and the dignity
          of this Assyrian. There is no other way by which she can come from
          the Suburra, therefore we might stay very well where we are; but I
          think it might be still better to await her coming where there are
          either tombs or larger trees to cast a shade over our equipage, in
          case the moon should take it into her head to be more kind to us
          than she was to Pona.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“By all
          means,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“most venerable
          man—and besides, the wind is rather chilly, therefore I shall be
          well pleased to have shelter as well as shade.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You shall have both,”</span> quoth he; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there is a thick grove of pines only a little way on.
          I believe there is a very grand tomb in the midst of them, in case
          you should prefer to sit under it.—By the bye,”</span> he
          continued, after some little pause, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is
          odd enough that it should be so; but I believe it is the very place
          where all that race of the Sempronii, to which a certain young
          damsel belongs, have been burnt and buried ever since Rome was a
          city. You cannot see their tomb yet; but that is only from the
          thickness of the trees, some of which are, I suppose, even older
          than itself. Now I remember me, it was just there that they set up
          two winters ago the funeral pile of old Caius—I mean the father of
          the Lady Athanasia, whom you saw at Capito’s villa. They are a very
          noble race, and although none of the richest now-a-days, there is
          not a prouder in Rome. I saw the procession at that old man’s
          funeral myself, and I think the images of his ancestors that they
          carried before him, would have reached half way from hence to the
          Great Road. Grim, dusty figures, I trow they were; <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but I doubt not there had been many a
          haughty captain among them when they were alive.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These words were
          spoken as we were moving onwards towards this same grove of pines,
          and before he had made an end of speaking, we could clearly hear
          the wind sighing among their branches, and along the dry
          underground. And on coming to them I found that he had said truly
          there was a tomb in the midst of them, for a very noble, high,
          circular tower was indeed there, which, from the grayness of its
          walls, and luxuriance of ivy, had the appearance of being at least
          as ancient as any of the surrounding trees. The only method of
          access to the inside, seemed to be by means of a winding stair,
          which rose on the exterior from the ground to the summit—a method
          not unusual in Roman sepulchres—and it was on one of the steps of
          this stair that I seated myself, where, between the shaded wall on
          the one side, and the pine branches on the other, I was effectually
          concealed. As for Dromo, I know not whether it was that he coveted
          not exactly such close proximity to the stones of such an edifice;
          but instead of ascending with me, he took up a position beside one
          of the largest pines over against me.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although the
          moon had got rid of her clouds, and the sky, where any of it could
          be seen, was abundantly brilliant, the natural darkness of that
          funereal grove was such, that very little difference could be
          produced in the midst of it by any variation on the face of any
          nightly luminary. The tower itself received some of the moonbeams
          on its carved surface; but its contemporary trees participated not
          in any such illumination,—one solemn shade covering all things
          beneath the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg
          209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>influence of their growth. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I can scarcely see you, Dromo,”</span> said I;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“but I think that speck must be your beard,
          and if so, I beg you would tell me what it is you really have in
          view by all this preparation? Do you expect me to stay here on a
          tomb-stone all night, merely because you wish to have an
          opportunity of terrifying poor Rubellia by some ghost-like howl or
          other when she passes you?—which, by the way, it seems by no means
          certain she will do at all. Or what is your
          purpose?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Hush!”</span> was his
          answer; <span class="tei tei-q">“ask no questions, but hem thrice
          if you hear a footstep—for young ears are the keenest.”</span>
          Accordingly silence was kept so strictly, that, in spite of the
          chillness of the stone on which I sate, I presently fell into a
          sort of dozing slumber.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By degrees,
          however,—nor, considering the hour and the fatigue I had undergone,
          is it wonderful that it should have been so,—my sleep must have
          become sufficiently profound, for I did not at first, on waking
          from it, very well remember either where I was, or for what purpose
          I had come thither. And, indeed, I have little doubt my slumbers
          might have continued till day-break, but for the interruption I am
          now to mention.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And yet it
          seemed as if even in my sleep I had been prepared for this by some
          strange anticipation, for although it was a near sound of singing
          voices that dispelled my slumbers, and made me start from the stone
          on which I had placed myself, I could not help feeling as if that
          sound were not altogether new to me;—whether it were that the
          half-sensible ear had been already ministering indistinctly to the
          dreaming spirit, or that some purely fantastic prelude had been
          vouch<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name=
          "Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>safed to the real
          music. I started up suddenly, that much is certain, and listened
          with astonishment, yet not altogether with such surprise as might
          have been expected to attend a transition so hasty from sleep to
          waking, and from silence to the near neighbourhood of sounds at
          once so strange and so sweet. With breathless curiosity,
          nevertheless, with awe, and not entirely I think without terror,
          did I listen to the notes which seemed to ascend out of the
          habitation of the noble dead into the nightly air—wild, yet solemn,
          as if breathed from the bosom of a stately repose and a pensive
          felicity; insomuch, that almost I persuaded myself I was hearing
          the forbidden sounds of another world, and the thought came over
          me,—yet almost I think at that moment without farther disturbing
          me,—what fearful interpretations the old poets have affixed to such
          untimely communion, and how the superstition of all antiquity has
          shrunk from its omen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My first
          impulse, after a moment had elapsed, was to call on Dromo, and I
          did so, at first in a low whisper, and then two or three times more
          loudly—but all equally in vain, for no answer was returned; and
          though I strained my eyes in gazing on the place where I had last
          seen him, yet there I could perceive no trace whatever of any human
          figure. The moonlight indeed shewed with more distinctness than
          before the tall stem of the old pine-tree against which he had been
          leaning; but no motion, nor the least appearance of whiteness,
          could either my eyes or my imagination discover there. I might
          easily, you will say, have stept across the road, and entirely
          satisfied myself; but I know not well <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>what it was that nailed me to the place where
          I stood, and prevented me even from once thinking of doing so. The
          calm sepulchral music, my friends, still continued to stream from
          the recess of the mausoleum, and painless awe held me there, as if
          by a charm incontrollable. I gazed upwards, and beheld the moon
          riding above the black pine tops, in a now serene and cloudless
          heaven. The wind also had passed away, as it appeared, with the
          clouds it had agitated. The bird of night was asleep on her unseen
          bough; and all was silent as death, except only the dwelling of the
          departed; and a certain indescribable delight was beginning, as I
          gazed and listened, to be mixed with the perturbation wherewith at
          first I had been inspired.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And I know not
          how long I might have stood so, but while I was yet listening to
          this mysterious music, there was mingled with its expiring cadence
          the sound of a heavy footstep on the staircase above me, and
          looking up, I perceived in the moonlight the figure of a man, clad
          in a white gown, but having a naked sword stretched forth in his
          hand, immediately over the place whereon I was standing. I obeyed
          the first natural impulse, and leaped downwards swiftly on seeing
          him; but this availed me nothing, for he also leaped, and almost
          before my feet had touched the ground, I felt the grasp of his hand
          upon my shoulder, and that so strongly, that I perceived plainly
          there was as little possibility of escape as of resistance. I made
          therefore no farther effort, but suffered him to do with me as he
          pleased; and he, on his part, said not a single word, but still
          retaining his hold, pointed with his sword to the same steps from
          which I had descended, and com<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>pelled me to mount them before him, up to the
          very summit of the round tower.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why is this, sir?”</span> said I; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and whither do you conduct me?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace,”</span> was all his answer; and, in like manner
          as he had made me climb the exterior, so also he compelled me to
          begin the descent of a similar flight of steps, which led down from
          an aperture above, into the interior of the edifice. And although I
          must confess to you that I obeyed not this silent guidance without
          considerable fear, yet I strove as well as I could to control
          myself. I moved with a step in which I think not there could be
          perceived any trembling.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet you will
          admit that even had I been master at that moment of less firmness,
          I might have been excusable; for looking down, I perceived that a
          lamp was burning in the midst of the sepulchral tower far below me,
          and saw sitting around it a company of eight or ten persons, at
          whose mercy, it was quite visible, I must be placed. Neither, if I
          might judge from the demeanour of the person that was bringing me
          into their assembly, did there appear to be any great room for
          dependance on them; for, as to themselves, not one of them looked
          up towards me as I was stepping down, and being wrapped in their
          cloaks, I had no means of discovering what manner of persons they
          were. The way in which I had been treated, however, by one of their
          number, was a sufficient evidence, either that they conceived
          themselves to have been injured by my being there, or that they
          were capable of taking some undue advantage of my helpless
          condition. The calmness of their attitudes, and the recollection of
          the sounds <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg
          213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>that I had heard, inclined me to the former of
          these suppositions; and when I perceived that not one of them
          stirred, even till I had reached the lowmost step of the interior
          staircase, in this, without question, I already felt myself
          considerably strengthened.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold,”</span> said my guide, as I at length touched
          the marble floor of the mausoleum itself—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Behold proof, and that living, that my suspicions were
          not quite so groundless as you were pleased to imagine. Here is a
          man whom I found listening, even on the very steps of this tower.
          It is for you to decide what shall be done with the
          eaves-dropper.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this the
          whole company sprung at once to their feet, and I perceived
          evidently, from the surprise expressed in their looks and
          attitudes, that until that moment not one of them had been aware of
          my approach. I was about to speak, and declare my innocence of any
          treachery, or even of any knowledge concerning the purpose of their
          meeting; but before I could do so, one of them, and I think the
          oldest of all that were present, having in an instant recovered the
          tranquillity which my arrival had disturbed, said to me in a voice
          of the utmost gentleness, <span class="tei tei-q">“Young man, what
          has brought thee hither, or who sent thee? Art thou indeed a spy,
          and was it thy purpose to betray our assembly?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know
          nothing of your assembly, or of its purpose; I fell asleep by
          accident on the outside of this tower, and, when I awoke, the music
          that I heard detained me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Examine the stripling,”</span> quoth he that had
          conducted me—<span class="tei tei-q">“examine his
          person.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“His looks belie
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name=
          "Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>him,”</span> replied
          the senior, <span class="tei tei-q">“if you have cause for
          suspicion. But if you will it so, search the young man.”</span> And
          with that my guide, laying his unsheathed sword upon a table, or
          altar of black marble, proceeded to search my garments, and finding
          in my bosom the scroll which I had received from Tisias, he glanced
          on it for a moment, and then handing it to the senior, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, sirs, doubt ye if ye
          will.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Before heaven—it is the book
          of the holy Luke!”</span> said the other; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“this is indeed suspicious. How came this scroll into
          thy hands, young man? Art thou aware that one of the books of the
          Christians has been found in thy bosom?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I know it,”</span> said I; <span class="tei tei-q">“it
          is one of the books of their faith, and I have read in it this
          evening for the first time.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Then
          thou art not thyself a Christian?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I received the book from one Christian,”</span> said
          I, waiving the question; <span class="tei tei-q">“and I made
          promise to deliver it into the hands of
          another?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Name the Christian who
          gave thee this book!”</span> said my stern guide.—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tisias of Antioch,”</span> I replied; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the same who died yesterday in the
          Amphitheatre.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> quoth
          he, again; <span class="tei tei-q">“and I suppose it was there he
          gave it to you. Every one knows the name of Tisias. Name, if you
          please, the person to whom you are to deliver the
          book.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“You shall pardon me,”</span>
          said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I will not. You may call me
          an eaves-dropper, if you will; but you shall find I am no traitor.
          It is a Roman—a noble Roman lady to whom I must give this book; and
          I would not tell you her name although you should slaughter me here
          in this tomb, which I have entered living and without
          guilt.”</span> And having said this, I folded my arms, and stood
          still, abiding their will.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But scarcely had
          I finished these words, ere I felt a small trembling hand laid upon
          my shoulder, and looking round, I perceived Athanasia herself, who
          whispered into my ear,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Valerius, was the
          book for me? If so, you may say it boldly, and I will vouch for
          your word.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“For you, lady,”</span>
          I answered in the same tone, <span class="tei tei-q">“and for none
          other. You well know that I was present in his prison the night
          before his death; so far at least you can confirm what I have
          said.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said she, addressing the old man that had
          before questioned me, <span class="tei tei-q">“I know this young
          man: and I believe what he has said, and will be answerable for his
          fidelity. It was he that went in to our friend the other night in
          his prison, and the book was intrusted to him by the old man, that
          it might be given into my hands. His name is Valerius—Caius
          Valerius—and he is by birth a noble Roman.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Say you so, lady?”</span> interrupted my original
          conductor; <span class="tei tei-q">“then I ask his pardon. I have
          wronged Caius Valerius; but both you and he must forgive me, for it
          must be confessed he was found in a very extraordinary
          situation.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Even so,”</span> I replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          have nothing to complain of. I perceive that I am present in an
          assembly of Christians; but he shall do me much wrong that thinks I
          bear any enmity to them,—or, from all that I have yet seen or read,
          to the faith which they profess. I have read part of that
          book,”</span> I continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“for I made
          promise to Tisias that I should do so before giving it to
          Athanasia; and I trust I shall still be permitted by her to read
          more of it before it is finally demanded from
          me.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, read it!”</span> said
          Athanasia, gently again whis<span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>pering to me. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh yes,
          read the book, Valerius, and may God enlighten the reader.”</span>
          And so saying, she herself took up the scroll from the table on
          which it was lying, and gave it again into my hands.—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“There was also a letter for you,”</span> said I,
          receiving it, <span class="tei tei-q">“but that I left at
          home.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“No matter,”</span> said
          Athanasia, <span class="tei tei-q">“you shall give me the letter
          and the book both together hereafter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In the meantime,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I suppose it were better I should retire.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Young sir,”</span> said the senior, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that is as you please; in a little while we shall all
          be moving towards the city. Stay with us till then, if such be your
          will; that which you may hear, can at least do you no harm.
          Already, I doubt not, you have seen enough to despise the ignorant
          calumnies of our enemies.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When he had said
          so, the old man walked to the side of the sepulchre, and took out
          from behind one of the urns that stood there, (ranged in their
          niches,) a small casquet, which, returning, he placed before him on
          the marble table. Then, opening the casquet, he brought forth a
          silver goblet, and a salver containing some little pieces of bread;
          and, untying from his neck a massive cross of gold, he set that
          also on the table, between the cup and the salver. In brief, the
          Christian priest, (for such, as you already see, he was,) had
          finished his preparation, and was about to commence the
          administration of the blessed Eucharist. And when all the rest were
          kneeling before the table, Athanasia, laying her hand upon my arm,
          beckoned to me to kneel by her side; and so indeed I would have
          done in my ignorance, had not the priest himself pointed to
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name=
          "Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a station a few yards
          behind the lady, to which, accordingly, I drew back—apart from
          those who were to be privileged with the participation of those
          holy symbols.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scarcely had
          they composed themselves in their places, and listened to the first
          words of the appointed service, when I, standing there by myself,
          thought, unless my ears deceived me, there must be some one on the
          outer stair-case of the tower; and my eyes instinctively, I
          suppose, were fixed upon the aperture, which, as I have told you,
          was in the high roof above the circle of the niched walls. Here,
          however, when I first looked, there was nothing to be seen, but the
          round spot of the sky, far up in the midst of the marble roof; but
          while I was looking steadfastly, that space was suddenly
          diminished; and a dog bayed, and at the same moment a voice which I
          well knew, screamed, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have them—I hold
          them—let them burst the net if they can.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cry of Pona
          disturbed effectually the Christian priest, and the whole of those
          that were with him. Rising up hastily from their knees, they stood
          all together around the table, while the old man, having kissed
          both the cup and the cross, restored them as quickly as he could to
          the casket from which they had been taken. But while the priest was
          doing this, he that found me on the stair appearing to revert into
          his suspicion, and looking sternly upon me where I stood, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Is this then the innocence which we
          spared! Is this the noble Roman for whom Athanasia pledged herself?
          Speak, brethren, what shall be done to this traitor, by whom, even
          more than by those dogs of the tombs, it is a shame for us that we
          have been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
          218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class=

          his sword again, and it seemed as if he would have smitten me to
          the ground without farther question. But Athanasia threw herself
          swiftly between him and me. <span class="tei tei-q">“For shame,
          Cotilius,”</span> said she; <span class="tei tei-q">“such
          suspiciousness is unworthy of a Roman knight.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You say well, noble damsel,”</span> quoth the old
          priest, interrupting her; <span class="tei tei-q">“but you might
          say also that such cruelty is unworthy of a soldier of Christ.
          Peace, peace, children; there is no evil in the youth, nor, if
          there were, would it be our part to avenge it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While he was
          saying this, three or four blazing torches were thrust down into
          the place from above, and Athanasia, laying her hand upon my arm,
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Look up, Caius, I see helmets.—Alas!
          am I not already here? why, if they will slay me, should they drag
          me away now from the tomb of my fathers?”</span> I felt the
          trembling of her hands, and she leaned upon my shoulder. I know
          not, I will confess to you, whether at that moment I tasted more of
          pleasure or of pain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But by this time
          several of the soldiers had already begun to descend into the
          tower, and before another minute had elapsed, we found ourselves
          surrounded by the flame of their torches. And he that seemed to
          lead the party, after counting us one by one, said, turning to his
          companions, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, an old woman has told
          the truth for once—here are even more I think than she warned us
          of.—Come along, worthy people, you must not keep the Tribune
          waiting for you all night, and our watch is well-nigh expired
          already. Come, mount the stair—it will take a good half hour yet, I
          believe, to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg
          219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>lodge you all safely in the Tullian—And do
          you,”</span> he added, laying his hand on the hilt of Cotilius’
          sword—<span class="tei tei-q">“do you, brave sir, allow me to save
          you the trouble of carrying this bauble.”</span> Nor was the stern
          knight so foolish as to dispute the command; but having yielded up
          his sword, he forthwith began to ascend, one or two spearmen
          preceding him with their torches. The priest followed, and so did
          the rest; the last being Athanasia and myself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On every side
          around the old tower, when I looked from the summit of it, I
          perceived foot soldiers drawn up in a double line, while the road
          along which I had come with Dromo, was occupied by a band of
          horsemen, one of whom moved forward when he saw us descending, as
          if to take cognizance of the number and quality of the surprised
          assembly. His long cloak being muffled about his ears as he sate,
          and the shadow of his helmet falling deeply, I did not at first
          suspect who it was; but he had not counted half the party to the
          superior Officer behind him, ere I recognized him from the sound of
          his voice; and who, think ye, should it be but my good friend
          Sabinus?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion,
          when his eye detected me, checked his horse so sharply that the
          animal bounded into the air; and, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Valerius!”</span> quoth he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ha! by the life of Cæsar, what is the meaning of this?
          Valerius in a Christian synagogue! By all the gods, there must be
          some mistake.”</span> But before I, in my confusion, could make any
          answer to these exclamations, his eye chanced to glance on
          Athanasia, who, trembling, still retained the support of my arm;
          whereupon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ha! ha!”</span> said he, in a
          quite different tone of voice, <span class="tei tei-q">“there is a
          lady in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg
          220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the case.”</span> And then, stooping in his
          seat, he whispered, half laughing, into my ear, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My most hypocritical smooth-face, you shall see what
          is the consequence of bringing these transatlantic pranks of yours
          to Rome. By Hercules, you wild dog, it may cost you some little
          trouble to get out of this scrape.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having said so,
          he turned his horse, and rejoining the troop, appeared to enter
          into close conversation with him who sate at the head of the line.
          Of what my friend said, I could catch nothing more than certain
          vehement oaths, while, all the time, the Tribune (for such he was)
          continued to shake his head, in a way significant at once of doubt
          and determination. The end was, that he pointed with his sword; and
          Sabinus forced his horse backwards, at one plunge, into the place
          from which he had advanced.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our party were
          immediately separated one from another. I saw the priest lifted on
          a mule and hurried away towards the city, with a horseman on each
          hand of him. The fiery Cotilius, and one or two more, were
          compelled to follow, with similar attendance, in the same
          direction; others, again, had their horses’ heads turned more to
          the westward—but all departed at speed, and were soon lost to my
          view among the projections of the tombs. The last that remained to
          be disposed of were Athanasia and myself, and for a moment I had
          some hope that we might perhaps be intrusted to the same guards;
          but this hope was in vain, and after I perceived that it was so,
          scarcely even was time permitted to me for bidding her farewell. To
          kiss her hand, and to whisper a single word of parting hope into
          her ear, was all I could do. A tear rolled from her <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cheek and fell upon my hand; yet she
          smiled faintly upon me, and <span class="tei tei-q">“Hope,”</span>
          said she—<span class="tei tei-q">“yes, dear Valerius, Hope and
          Faith both go with me.”</span> And with that the pale maiden was
          separated from the arm to which she had trusted, and I saw her also
          mounted and borne away rapidly. A moment after, I found myself, in
          like manner, seized and lifted upon a horse, and almost before I
          could look around me, we had escaped from the flare of the torches,
          and the crowd of the soldiery, and were stretching at a rapid pace,
          I knew not whither, although I suspected, from the width of the
          road, that we had regained the Appian.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But I have
          forgotten to mention to you, that just at the moment when they were
          lifting Athanasia upon the mule that was to bear her from my sight,
          my eye caught a glimpse of the witch Pona, who was sitting at the
          root of one of the pine-trees, close to the tower. And behind her
          stood, leaning against the tree, a figure wrapped in a rich red
          cloak, which I suspected to be a female also, but could not be
          certain, because the countenance was concealed in the folds of the
          garment. To this person, whoever it might be, the witch turned
          round eagerly, while the soldiers were carrying off Athanasia. I
          saw no more, for, as I have told you, immediately afterwards I also
          was carried away.</p>

          VI.</span></span></h1>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our hasty pace
          had not borne us to any great distance from the place where all
          these things occurred, ere the sky, which, as ye have heard, had
          all that night been sufficiently variable, began to exhibit
          appearances which my two companions interpreted as significant of
          the approach of one of those nocturnal storms, to which, at that
          season of the year, the fair heaven of Italy is peculiarly subject.
          That they apprehended somewhat of this sort, I perceived from their
          looks, as they stopped for a moment to draw the hoods of their
          mantles over their brazen helmets; for words they uttered none,
          either to me or to each other, until our journey drew near its
          close. For me, however, the numberless agitations through which I
          had passed in the course of the few preceding hours, had, I
          suppose, communicated an unnatural measure of ardour to my boyish
          blood; for neither did I feel the night-breeze chill me as we
          rushed through it, nor partook, in any sort, of the desire my
          companions testified to cover themselves from the rain, which
          seemed to be about to discharge itself out of all those black and
          lowering clouds now gathered above our heads from every region of
          the heavens. When, on the contrary, the first heavy drops fell, I
          bared my <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg
          223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>forehead with the eagerness of one who, in a
          parched region, comes suddenly upon the margin of a well-spring.
          Nor did this sensation subside even after the storm had thickened
          to the utmost, and the dusty roads had drunk abundantly of the
          plashing rain. The strong wind blew with redoubled coolness upon my
          moistened neck—the rain-drops dashed on my hot hands; and I
          perceived, that, as is the nature of those animals, the thunder
          which was mustering in the air, filled my horse one moment with
          dread, and the next with a blind fierceness. At last the thunder
          shouted over-head, and its echoes spread wide and far on either
          side, until they seemed to be absorbed to the left in the remote
          depths of the Appenine, and on the right hand in the measureless
          bosom of the Western Sea—of which, as we galloped along the hill
          side, the broad lightning (unless my fancy deceived me) revealed
          ever and anon a distant and melancholy glimpse.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had passed a
          hill covered with towns, villages, and stately mansions, (which I
          afterwards learned was no other than the famous Alban,) ere the
          storm subsided beneath the influence of the reddening dawn. Yet
          even then we slackened not our pace, although the horses were by
          this time not a little exhausted with the swiftness of their
          motion, and the weight of their wet riders. On rode we in the
          growing light of the morning; but I perceived ere long that we had
          left the wide and magnificent Appian Way, and were pursuing the
          line of a narrower road, which seemed to carry us more and more
          westward.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We halted for a
          moment on the brow of a declivity, where three paths separated; and
          I perceived that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg
          224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>among my guides there was some little
          uncertainty as to which of these it behoved them to follow. While
          they were muttering together, I looked and beheld at length the
          wide sea heaving far below, over what appeared to me to be a forest
          as mighty as I had ever seen in my native island.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Old hoary oaks
          leaned on either hand quite over the narrow path-way, into which
          (after their brief pause of consultation) my conductors directed
          our course. Here and there, such a shield had those huge leafy
          boughs extended over the road, that the dust rose from amongst the
          feet of our horses as if all that night not one drop of rain had
          fallen there; although elsewhere, in the absence of such mighty
          trees, the water lying across the path in pools testified
          abundantly that the tempest had not spared the forest any more than
          the champaign. Vast waving gulfs of bay and ilex, with here and
          there some solitary pine raising itself proudly in the midst,
          seemed to stretch away on either hand between the groves of those
          gigantic oaks.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The path we
          followed carried us ever deeper and deeper into the bosom of the
          woods; and, at length, so buried were we in the windings of their
          stifling shade, that I had lost all notion of the direction in
          which I was moving; until, after two or three hot hours, weary man
          and jaded horse were, I believe, equally delighted with snuffing
          once more the open current of the air. We reached not the edge of
          the forest, however, before I could hear distinctly the dashing of
          the Mediterranean waves; and the last ascent we climbed laid open
          to my view a long sweep of the rolling waters, and their rocky
          coast garnished every where with the richness of super<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>incumbent woods. Far, very far, in the
          distant north, I thought I could recognize some of the stately
          towers of Ostium, bosomed apparently within the billows over which
          they presided. All between was one wide waste of wood and rock,
          save here and there a watch-tower perched on the margin, and
          whitened half-way up with the foam of the yet uncalmed sea.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, nor ever
          could I look upon the waters of the great deep, without something
          of that filial yearning which seems so natural to every native of
          our sea-girt island. But neither could I contrast the condition in
          which I now approached it, with the gay and hopeful mood in which I
          had so lately left it behind me, without many thoughts more sad and
          serious than as yet had frequently visited my bosom. What a strange
          brood of visions had passed before my eyes, since, but a few days
          before, I stept for the first time, light of heart, beneath the
          shadow of those far-off bulwarks! What new emotions had arisen, in
          the interval! How had every sense been gratified! how had every
          dream of imagination been exceeded! Yet what a void had been
          revealed within!—Alas! said I to myself, why is it that I have been
          subjected to all these novelties? Had I not done better to have
          remained, after all, where life flowed ever calmly—where affection
          hung over me like a protecting buckler, and my soul could sleep in
          the security of unbroken faith! But this was only for a moment. The
          thoughts of Athanasia haunted me more deeply and more firmly. I
          thought over every word she had spoken—every look of hers rose up
          in succession, with all the vividness of a beautiful and a troubled
          dream. I seemed to feel, as if she were yet present beside me,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name=
          "Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the trembling of her
          pale fingers upon my shoulder—I kissed the hand on which her
          parting tear had fallen, as if it were yet wet with the dear
          moisture. When I thought of the perils in which she must now be
          enveloped—of the pains she must have suffered—must at that moment
          be suffering,—it was as if I could have burst bands of iron, like
          flax, from off my hands. When a glimpse of the darker future opened
          before me, I shuddered, and, urging my poor horse onwards in the
          recklessness of total abstraction, I perceived that even my guides
          pitied the agony of my despair.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We stopped
          before one of the watch-towers which, as I have told you, I had
          seen scattered along the edge of the sea. But this, when we came up
          to it, appeared larger than I had expected to find any of them. The
          narrow way, alongst which we had been riding, brought us close to
          its gate, on the side towards the land; but the rock shelving
          rapidly on the other side, gave it the semblance, at a little
          distance, of being suspended over the waves.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a
          building of rude, and apparently very antique structure, the under
          part square, but the upper circular; as is, for the most part, the
          old Roman fashion in such erections. And this, indeed, I doubt not,
          might have stood there long enough to have shewn a beacon, when
          some fleet of Syracuse or Carthage darkened the blue sea over
          against the Lestrigonian bay renowned in old song, or the
          snow-white promontory of Gaieta.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
          soldiers dismounted, and began to knock rather violently at the
          door; but some little time elapsed ere any sound from within
          responded to the clamour he raised. At last a hard and withered
          face made its appearance at a little opening above the door, and
          then the helmets passed, I suppose, for a sufficient warrant, for
          in a twinkling we heard the bolts creaking; the old <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>postern was soon set ajar, and forth
          stepped the venerable keeper. Imagine a tall, skinny man of
          threescore years, with a face as dry and yellow as ye have seen on
          the outside of a pye, and hair as white as ever the skill of a
          confectioner could represent, and legs bearing the same proportion
          to the feet, which the shaft of Saturn’s scythe usually does to its
          blade. Clothe the nether part of this figure in Dacian, or Gaulish
          breeches, throw a somewhat threadbare cloak over his shoulders, and
          to finish the outfit, deck his head with a casque of the Macedonian
          cut, that is to say, sitting close above the ears, and topped with
          a bristling plume of horse hair. The Warder stood with dignity, and
          listened with gravity, while one of my Prætorians whispered his
          message. On its conclusion, he shrugged his shoulders, and
          regarding me with a glance made up, I think, in pretty equal
          proportions, of surprise and contempt, signified by the motion of
          his hand that we might all three enter. He whistled at the same
          moment, and there came forth a comely damsel, who, with many
          blushes and smiles, took possession of the reins of our
          horses.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Stand there,”</span> quoth he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“stand there, little Cestia, and see if
          there be never a handful of corn to be got for the prince’s
          cattle,—stand there, and we shall be with you again anon.”</span>
          And then he also whispered something into the maiden’s ear, and I
          saw her looking at me from under her eyelids with an expression of
          very uncommon curiosity. Two or three curly-pated urchins, of
          different sizes, joined her at the same moment, and to them, in her
          turn, the maiden whispered; whereupon the eldest of the children
          retreating behind her, eyed me earnestly along the skirt of her
          tunic, while the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg
          229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>younger ones continued to gaze where they
          were, with looks of open stupidity and wonder. Of all this I could
          make nothing at the moment, but when we had got fairly into the
          inside of the tower, I heard the children whispering to each other,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“A Christian! A Christian! A Jew! A
          Jew!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lower part
          of the tower, into which I had now been conducted, seemed to form
          nothing more than one huge, bare, and quadrangular apartment,
          serving, I supposed (and rightly) at once as hall and vestibule to
          the upper chambers contained within the walls. A small flight of
          steps, in one of the corners, seemed to afford the only means of
          access to what was above; but from the position of a door
          immediately below these, it was we inferred that there were vaults
          under ground. Close beside this door there stood, upon a very rude
          pedestal, a still more rude bust, either of Jupiter, of Apollo, or
          of Hercules. The workmanship was such, that I could not be very
          certain which of the family it was intended to represent, nor
          whether the principal appendage was a club, a lyre, a bow, or a
          thunder-bolt; but it did not escape my observation, that the old
          keeper crept as close as he could to the sacred stone, as soon as I
          stepped over the threshold.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
          little boys that had come out to the door on our arrival, busied
          himself in setting forth a wooden board, whereon he placed in great
          order a huge piece of yellow cheese, and a heap of crisp white
          cakes of rye. A large jug of water also garnished the mess; but
          there seemed to be a little less of diligence, or more of
          difficulty, about the wine. After some pause, however, the mistress
          of the garrison appeared. A string of amber <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beads floated to and fro on the ocean of
          her bosom. She had fine golden bracelets on her arms too, but they
          were only half seen, being almost buried in fat; and she wore a
          flaxen wig, which did not entirely conceal the dark bristles below.
          At the girdle of the amazon hung, on the right side, the much
          desiderated bunch of keys, being balanced on the left by a dagger
          and toothpick case, almost of equal dimensions.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Will <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">you</span></span> drink to Cæsar, young
          man?”</span> cried the matron, ere the sitting had been much
          prolonged; <span class="tei tei-q">“will you drink honestly to the
          Emperor, in case you also have a full cup given you? and, by the
          by, I think you must have almost as much need of it as the
          rest.”</span> And, with this courteous invitation, I heard her
          whisper to one of my guards,—<span class="tei tei-q">“By Jove, ’tis
          a proper lad, after all; is this true that they have told me of
          him? Why, I believe, the young man has a red edge to his gown. What
          is his name? who is he?”</span>—I heard him answer,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the life of Cæsar, you know as much about him as
          any of us. There was a whole cluster taken last night a little way
          beyond the Capene-Gate, and he was one; but what they were about,
          or who he is, I know not, only he is certainly somebody, for I saw
          our Centurion salute him.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I saw
          him with Sabinus,”</span> whispered the other—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am quite sure of it, the last day the Amphitheatre
          was open; they sate together, and appeared
          familiar.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I pray you, sir,”</span>
          quoth the lady, raising her voice,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I pray
          you fill your cup, and here I pledge you to our better
          acquaintance. You shake your head—well. But what must be, must; and
          while you are with us, we may at least be good
          friends.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Thanks,”</span> said I,
          complying with her com<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg
          231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>mand; <span class="tei tei-q">“Here, then, is
          health to all present; and fair health to the great Trajan, says no
          one here more heartily than I.”</span>—I drank off the wine, and
          setting down the goblet, I believe I said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Excellent, by Jove,”</span> or something of that sort;
          for they all started when they heard what I said, and the old woman
          called out lustily, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fill him another cup
          to the brim, whether he be Christian or not. The young man at least
          swears by the gods, and drinks to Cæsar.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The old man,”</span> observed one of the
          soldiers,—<span class="tei tei-q">“he that was killed the other day
          in the Amphitheatre—he might have saved his head, even at the last
          moment, if he would have done as much.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well, well,”</span> quoth she again; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“let every one mind his own matters. Husband, bring
          down your book, and let the new-comer enter his name with his own
          hand.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having drained
          his cup, the keeper rose, and ere long returned with a musty scroll
          of parchment, which, having blown away the dust from it, he
          presented to me. I glanced over the record, and found in it the
          names of various persons, all apparently entered in their own
          handwriting; and most of them, as I could perceive, bearing date in
          the troublous reign of Domitian. The last was that of Marcus
          Protius Lamontanus, who, as it seemed, had been set free from his
          confinement immediately on the accession of Nerva; and immediately
          under this I wrote my own name, with that of my birthplace. The
          keeper read, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“So preserve me the
          power of Jove! A Valerius! and born in Britain! Can you be the son
          of the same Valerius who was Centurion in the ninth legion under
          Agricola?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“You have guessed
          rightly—I am the same.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Then
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name=
          "Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the more is the
          pity,”</span> he replied, in a grave voice, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that you should have entered, in such a case as this,
          the dwelling of one that was a true soldier beneath the eagle of
          your father. But forgive me if in any thing we have been
          disrespectful.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“There is no
          occasion,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“for any such
          apology. I am here as a prisoner, and have been treated with all
          courtesy beyond what a prisoner could expect.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By Hercules!”</span> interrupted the spouse,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I thought I had some knowledge of the
          face—Well, I hope ten years hence he will be as fine a man as his
          father was the day he slew the Caledonian giant, and tumbled him
          from his chariot in front of all the line—yes, in sight of Galgacus
          himself. It was the same day,”</span> said she, turning to her
          lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you were taken prisoner, and
          driven away into the woods.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“As
          witness these marks,”</span> quoth the man; and with that he
          stripped open his tunic, and displayed part of his breast, stamped
          with various figures of blue and yellow, after the northern
          fashion, and bearing withal the traces of two formidable
          wounds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The woman
          redoubled her kindness; but not wishing to interrupt festivity, I
          soon requested her to shew me the place where I was to be confined.
          And, indeed, as you may imagine, I had by this time not a little
          need of repose.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both she and her
          husband accordingly rose to usher me to my prison. I gave money to
          the soldiers, and requested them to inform Sabinus of the place to
          which I had been conveyed; but did not choose to write any thing,
          either to him or to Licinius, until I should have had a little time
          for reflection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My fatigue
          brought speedy sleep; and so profound, that before I again unclosed
          my eyes, the calm sea was already purple below me, and the sun
          about to set. But neither purple sea, nor golden sky, nor all the
          divine tranquillity of the evening air, could sooth my mind into
          repose, after I had once awaked to a sense of the situation into
          which I had been brought—I should say rather of the situation in
          which Athanasia was placed. For myself, I could not in seriousness
          fear any calamity worthy of the name,—if such should come, it must
          be my business to wrestle with it as I might. But to think of her,
          young, beautiful, innocent; and of all to which she might be
          exposed amidst the rude hands in which I had left her!</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some time had
          passed before my attention was attracted by a conversation carried
          on in the chamber below me, in which you will not be surprised that
          I should have felt myself interested, even although the distance
          was such that I could not distinguish one word that was said. I
          knew from the first moment that it was impossible I should be
          mistaken—I was perfectly certain it was Sabinus himself, who was
          talking with the old woman; and I at once suspected that the worthy
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name=
          "Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Centurion, having
          learned from the soldiers who carried me off, to what place they
          had conveyed me, had undertaken this speedy journey, for the
          purpose of comforting me in my confinement. The kindness with which
          he had treated me from the beginning of our acquaintance had been
          such, that I could have no occasion to wonder at his exerting
          himself to discover me; but I confess this alacrity was more than I
          had been prepared for, and I waited only for the moment when he
          should enter my apartment to throw myself upon his bosom, and
          intrust all my troubles to him, as to a friend and a brother. There
          was something, however, which I could not at all comprehend in the
          merriment which seemed to be reigning below on his arrival. Peals
          of female laughter interrupted the uniform hearty tone of the
          Centurion’s voice; and the feeble treble of the old Warder himself
          was stretched ever and anon in attempt at a chuckle.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last in they
          came, and Sabinus, embracing me affectionately, thrust into my hand
          a piece of parchment, which I perceived to be nothing less than an
          order for my immediate release. Then taking off his riding-cap, and
          rubbing with his handkerchief his most audacious and
          soldier-looking brows, <span class="tei tei-q">“My dear
          boy,”</span> quoth he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I see you are going
          to thank me—but wound not modesty by fine speeches. There was war
          before Helen—have a better care another time, and don’t pay Rome
          such a poor compliment, as to say that you can find nobody to charm
          you but a Christian damsel, and no place for flirtation but a
          gloomy tomb lined with urns and lachrymatories. My honest friend
          here was quite frightened with the idea of having such <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>an unbelieving reprobate as they said
          you were, under the same roof with her children. But now her fears
          are dispelled, for good souls are always tolerant to the little
          vagaries of young blood; so thank your hostess, my lad, kiss her
          hand, take one cup to the hearth of the old tower, and tighten your
          girdle.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well!”</span> quoth the woman; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“who should have thought when the soldiers brought him
          in with such mystery, that it was all for kissing by moonlight! I
          protest to Venus, they would have made me believe he had been
          caught eating an infant; but still I cannot quite pardon him.
          Well—well—we must e’en take good hope he will mend ere he
          dies.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Die?”</span> cried the Centurion; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“do you talk of dying to one that has scarcely yet
          begun to live!—Come, come, Caius, I hope, after all, you may never
          get into a worse scrape.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And if I do,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I hope I shall always be equally fortunate in my
          jailers.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“By the beard of Jove!”</span> quoth Sabinus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“it needs no great skill to see that you
          have been fortunate in that respect. I swear that, if the truth
          were known, you are almost as unwilling to leave this tower now, as
          you were last night to be torn away from another.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, Master Kæso,”</span> quoth she again, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“when will you have done with your joking? Well, your
          father loved a jest in his time himself; but now he, I suppose, is
          quiet enough. And he, good old man, how does he wear?—Can he still
          sit in his porch of a fine morning, and listen to the news, as he
          used to do, with his cup at his knee?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I trust the old grasshopper can still chirp when the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name=
          "Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sun shines. But to
          tell you the truth, it is long since I have seen him; and if this
          young blade has no objection, I mean to pay him a visit this very
          night. I am only just come home from Britain, and have not yet had
          leisure to salute my Lares.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I said something
          about being anxious to return as soon as possible to Rome; but the
          Centurion answered me with another shout, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come, come; she’s safe enough. I suppose you think
          every one gets out of jail as easily as yourself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I found it was
          out of the question to disapprove of any of the schemes of Sabinus;
          so, having saluted the hostess, and flung my purse to her children,
          (who, by the way, still regarded me with looks of apprehension,) I
          accompanied him with a good grace to the gate. I made inquiry
          before I went forth concerning the old jailer likewise; but I could
          easily gather from the expression of face with which his wife
          accompanied her indistinct reply, that he had, long before that
          time, reached a state in which she felt little desire to exhibit
          him. The Centurion whistled as he stepped across the threshold, and
          there forthwith drew near a soldier, wearing the Prætorian helmet,
          (now sufficiently familiar to my sight,) and leading in his hand
          three horses. In the rear, I recognized, not without satisfaction,
          the busy countenance of my friend Dromo, whose ass did not appear
          quite so eager to join the party as its rider. A few sturdy thumps,
          however, at last brought the Cretan close to us, who saluted me
          with great appearance of joy, and then whispered into my ear,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Jove! we must keep silence for the
          present. What a story I have to tell; and I suppose there is one to
          hear <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name=
          "Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>likewise—but all in
          good season. We must not crack nuts before monkeys. I have a letter
          for you,”</span> he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“from Sextus,
          and another from Licinius.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion
          sprung on his trusty war-horse, who seemed to rejoice in the
          feeling of his weight; and we were soon in motion. I asked no
          questions either about the course or distance, but rode by his side
          so silently, that he bestowed on me many good-natured rebukes, for
          suffering a little affair of love to distress me so greatly.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Cheer up now,”</span> quoth he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and do not make me repent of carrying you
          to my father’s house, by shewing the old man, who has had enough of
          troubles, such a countenance as must make him think of Orcus, even
          although he did not know himself to be near its gates. It is more
          than a year since I have seen him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This sort of
          speech he repeated so often, that I thought the best way would be
          to tell him frankly the true history of the adventure, from whose
          immediate consequences he had delivered me. I told him, therefore,
          every thing about both Tisias and Athanasia, and, indeed, kept
          nothing from him in the whole matter, except only what referred to
          the impression made on my own mind by what I had read of the
          Christian book,—for, as to this subject, it was one which I totally
          despaired of being able to make him in any measure comprehend,—and
          besides, the state of my own mind was still so uncertain in regard
          to it, and my information so imperfect, that I could not trust
          myself with speaking of it to any one, until I should have had
          leisure for more both of reading and of reflection.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He preserved
          silence for some minutes, and then said, <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“In truth, Caius, you
          have distressed me. I thought it was merely some little frolic born
          of an hour, to be forgotten in a day; but I cannot refuse you my
          sympathy. Would I had more to offer!”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dear Sabinus,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I know not how to thank you. You saw me but a few days
          ago the merriest young fellow that ever trod the pavement of
          Rome—happy in the moments that passed, and full of glad hopes for
          all that were to come; but now I feel myself quite changed. Almost
          I wish I had never left my British fields; and yet I should never
          have seen Athanasia.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Poor
          fellow!”</span> quoth he, laying his hand on the mane of my horse,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I perceive there is, indeed, no trifling
          in your case. Compose yourself; whatever chances there may be in
          your favour will never be bettered by despondence.”</span> He
          paused a little, and proceeded—<span class="tei tei-q">“The worst
          of the whole is this new bitterness against these Christians.
          Except during Nerva’s time, there was always some punishment to be
          feared by them, in case of being detected; but there was a way of
          managing things in almost every case, and people were well enough
          disposed to grant immunities which were always attended with some
          good to the Fisk. Nero and Domitian, to be sure, acted
          otherwise—but these were madmen; and even they did so only by fits
          and starts. But now, when a prince like Trajan has taken up the
          matter, it is no wonder that one should consider it more seriously.
          One cannot help fancying he must have had some good reason before
          he began—that is one thing; and having once begun, he is not the
          man to drop it lightly—which is a more weighty consideration. Do
          you think there is positively no chance of her giving <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>up this dream, when she finds what it
          has exposed her to?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No,”</span> said I; <span class="tei tei-q">“I am sure
          she will not, nor can I wish it would be otherwise with
          her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> he resumed, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          enter into your feelings so far, my friend, even on that point. I
          cannot imagine you to have been so deeply smitten with a girl of a
          flighty unsteady character. But then this is not a case to be
          judged of on common principles. It is no light thing to be exposed
          to such examinations as are now set afoot for these people; and if
          she behaves herself so resolutely as you seem to expect, what is
          the end of it? I consider it highly probable—for there is no
          friendship in uncandid speaking—that, in spite of all her friends
          can do, they will banish her at the very least; scarcely dare I
          speak of it, but even worse than banishment has heretofore befallen
          Romans—ay, Roman ladies too,—and these as high in birth and place
          as Athanasia.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My dear Sabinus,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“do not imagine that now for the first time all these
          things are suggested to me. Imagine rather, how, unable for a
          moment to expel them from my mind, I have spent these miserable
          hours. Her friends, too, what must not be their alarm!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The thing was so done,”</span> quoth the Centurion,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that I think it is impossible it should
          have made much noise as yet. If there was in the family no
          suspicion that the lady had any connection with these people, they
          must be in perfect perplexity. I lay my life they take it for
          granted she has had some private intrigue, and has gone off with
          her lover.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“when
          they hear the truth, it will be still worse than this in their
          eyes. Yet it appears fit that no time should be lost in making them
          acquainted with the real state of the case. O Sabinus, I foresee
          that in all these things I shall have need of your counsel and your
          help.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You shall have them both, my dear boy,”</span> said
          he,—<span class="tei tei-q">“you shall have them both to the
          uttermost. But there is no question at all about the propriety of
          telling the relations all you know. Licinius is probably well
          acquainted with them. I am almost sorry for having prevented your
          immediate return to the city; and yet one night will soon be
          over.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But Athanasia herself——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ah! that indeed is a point of some difficulty. It was
          merely from having remembered who the men were that rode off with
          you, that I was enabled to learn so soon whither you yourself had
          been conveyed. But the party consisted of a few men out of almost
          every one of our cohorts,—those, in short, that were on duty,
          scattered up and down in different parts of the city; and I may not
          find it very easy to discover who had the care of any other
          individual.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But Athanasia——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“True,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I had
          not thought of it. There was but one female besides herself. That
          will furnish a clue. You may rely on it, I shall easily find out
          the place to which they have taken her; but then where, and at what
          distance that may be, Heaven only knows; for it seemed as if every
          prisoner were to be carried to a separate place of confinement. At
          all events, even if we knew where she is, we could do nothing at
          present. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg
          241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Come, cheer up, now you have unburdened
          yourself of all this load. I shall be ready to start as early as
          ever you please in the morning.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time the
          moon was in full splendour, and nothing could be more beautiful
          than the scenery of the native place of Sabinus, as we drew near to
          its precincts. A little gentle stream, which kissed our path, did
          not desert us as we entered the village, but murmured all through
          its humble street. Street, indeed, I should not say; for there were
          dwelling-houses on the one side only, the other being occupied with
          gardens, in the midst of which I saw the Doric portico of a small
          temple. In front of this a bridge crossed the stream, and there we
          were met by a troop of maidens, who seemed to be moving toward the
          sacred place with some purpose of devotion, for they were singing
          in alternate measures, and in their hands they carried garlands.
          Some recognized Sabinus, and, without interrupting their chant,
          saluted him with their laughing eyes. We halted our horses, and saw
          them proceed all together into the hallowed enclosure, which they
          did, not by means of the bridge, although they were close by it,
          but by wading hand in hand through the stream below; whose pebbles,
          as it appeared from the evenness of their motion, dared not to
          offer any violence to the delicate feet that trod upon them.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Happy creatures,”</span> said I to the
          Centurion; <span class="tei tei-q">“of a surety they think these
          moonbeams shine on nothing but glad faces like their own. Alas!
          with what heart does poor Athanasia at this moment contemplate this
          lovely heaven!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Nay,
          Valerius,”</span> quoth he, <span class="tei tei-q">“if people were
          not to be contented with their own share of sorrow, would the
          world, think ye, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg
          242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>be
          worth living in? I hope Athanasia herself will ere long sing again
          by the moonlight.—But stop, here is my own old haunt, the abode of
          our village barber, and now I think of it, perhaps it might be as
          well that you and Dromo should remain here for a moment, till I
          ride on to the house, and let them know you are coming, for the
          sudden sight of strange faces might alarm the old folks at this
          hour.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had scarcely
          said so, when the tonsor himself, hearing, I suppose, the sound of
          our horses’ feet, ran out with his razor and basin in his hand, to
          see what might be the matter. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ah, good
          Virro,”</span> quoth the Centurion, <span class="tei tei-q">“with
          joy do I once more behold your face. Well, the girls still sing,
          and Virro still shaves; so every thing, without question, goes
          well.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“The Centurion
          himself!”</span> replies the barber; <span class="tei tei-q">“so
          Venus smile upon me, it is Kæso Sabinus, who I began to think would
          never come back again.—Here, boy, bring out a cup of the best.
          Alight, I pray you—well, at least, you shall kiss the rim of the
          goblet.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I will,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I promise you, my good friend, and that in
          a minute or two; but I must first salute my father; and, in the
          meantime, I leave with you in pledge, good Virro, my excellent
          friend here, and the most knowing Cretan that ever landed at
          Brundusium.—Dismount, Valerius, I shall be with you again ere Virro
          can half smoothen the chin of Dromo, which even this morning shewed
          no small need of trimming.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Well,
          well,”</span> said the tonsor, <span class="tei tei-q">“eagles will
          have their own way. Be speedy.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion
          had set the spur to his charger; and we, in obedience to his
          command, submitted ourselves <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>to the guidance of the oily-faced little
          barber. A stripling was already holding two horses at the door, but
          another came out and took care of our animals, and we entered,
          exchanging courteous salutations, the tonsorial penetralia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were
          occupied by as various and talkative a company, as the imagination
          of Lucilius ever assembled in such a place. In the middle of the
          room, which was spacious, though low-roofed, hung a huge shield of
          brass, with a dozen mouths of flame blazing around the edge of its
          circumference, close beside which sat a man with a napkin tucked
          about his neck, the one side of whose visage, still besmeared with
          a thick coat of lather, testified that the curiosity of Virro had
          induced him to abandon a yet uncompleted job. The half-trimmed
          physiognomy, however, displayed no sign of impatience, and the
          barber himself seemed not to think any apology necessary, for he
          resumed his operations with an air of great cheerfulness, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Neighbours all, here is Kæso Sabinus, that
          is now the Centurion, come once more to gladden the old village
          with his merry face, and that, I promise you, is prettily tanned
          since we knew him first.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This piece of
          news appeared not a little to interest several of those who were
          sitting under the tonsor’s roof. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ha!”</span> said one, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          noble Centurion! Well, has he brought home a wife with him at last?
          for the talk was, that he had been seen at the Amphitheatre, paying
          great court to one of the richest ladies in Rome.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“A wife?”</span> says Virro, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“no, no, centurions and barbers can do without wives.
          But if he is to have one, I shall be happy to hear she is rich; for
          centurions, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg
          244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>after all, sometimes carry most of their
          silver upon their helmets, as we do most of our brass on our
          basins.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Indeed,”</span> said I,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I never heard of it before.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“If it please you, friend,”</span> said another of
          them, <span class="tei tei-q">“is this the same Sabinus that has
          lately been in Britain?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Britain,”</span> quoth an ancient dame; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I never heard that name before—Britain! I know it
          not—I know not where he hath been, but they told me it was over the
          sea, perhaps in Palestine.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Tut,
          dame,”</span> interrupted the barber, (who was now busy on Dromo,)
          <span class="tei tei-q">“you think every one goes to Palestine,
          because your own boy carried a spear with Titus; but you know they
          ruined the city, and killed all the Jews and Christians, and there
          is no occasion for sending Centurions thither
          now.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Killed all the Jews and
          Christians, said you?”</span> quoth another. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I think the old dame has the better of you as to that
          point at least, Virro. Not Trajan himself will ever be able to kill
          them all; the superstition spreads like a pestilence. It was but
          last night that a hundred of them were taken together in one place,
          eating human flesh.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Human
          flesh!”</span> quoth the barber. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, ye
          gods, why do ye endure such barbarians!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Human flesh!”</span> echoed Dromo, springing from his
          seat, and I looked at him, and saw that the barber in his horror
          had made in truth a deep incision upon the cheek of the poor man.
          The blood, oozing from the cut, had already traced a river of
          crimson upon the snowy surface of his well-soaped chin. It was this
          that had deranged the philosophic composure and customary phlegm of
          my Cretan; and no wonder; but the enthusiastic tonsor took no
          notice of what had occurred.—<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          he proceeded, and he pointed to the roof with his razor as he
          spake—<span class="tei tei-q">“Great Jove! I adjure thee! are all
          thy lightnings spent; is there never a thunderbolt
          remaining?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In the meantime,”</span> quoth one of the bystanders,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“they are in the hand not of Jove, but of
          Trajan, and he, I think, cannot now be accused of treating these
          wretches with too much lenity. You have all heard of that
          Tisias?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“We have,”</span> cried
          another; <span class="tei tei-q">“but what was a single individual
          to this great assembly? what a sight will it be the day they are
          all executed!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I think,”</span> said the same person who had inquired
          whether our Centurion were the Sabinus that had been in
          Britain,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I think you are overrating the
          numbers of that assembly. I heard of no more than a
          dozen.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This stranger
          (for such he seemed) had probably taken that day a considerable
          journey, for his tunic and boots were covered with dust. He was
          attired in the plainest manner, but notwithstanding, there was
          something about him which gave one the idea of rank superior to the
          company in which he was seated; and his complexion was so dark that
          I could not help thinking to myself,—I am not the only provincial
          in the room; here is certainly some well-born African or
          Asiatic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You have not told me, however,”</span> said he, after
          a pause, <span class="tei tei-q">“whether or not this be the
          Sabinus that was lately in Britain.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is

          him,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“you may have an
          opportunity of seeing him immediately, for I expect him here every
          moment to conduct me to his father’s villa, which is hard
          by.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> quoth the barber, who by this time had
          ended, without fresh misadventure, the trimming of the
          Cretan—<span class="tei tei-q">“well, I hope he will stay for a
          moment when he does come, and then we shall be sure to hear the
          truth as to this story about the Christian assembly. They may talk
          as they please, but may Jove devote me, if I had Cæsar’s ring upon
          my finger for one night, this should be the last of
          them.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“And how, friend,”</span>
          said the stranger, <span class="tei tei-q">“by what means, if I may
          ask you, should you propose so speedily to do away with this
          fast-spreading abomination?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Look
          ye, sirs,”</span> quoth he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I would place
          myself thus in my tribunal”</span>—(he took his seat at a little
          table, beside a goblet of wine, as he spake,) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I would seat myself thus in the midst of a field, as
          Cato and the great Censors of old used to do. I would cause Rome to
          be emptied—man, woman, and child should pass before me; and every
          one that did not acknowledge the gods as he passed, by all the
          gods! he should sprawl upon a tree in presence of all the people.
          What avails watching, prying, spying, and surprising? I should make
          shorter work of it, I trow.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You may say what you will,”</span> said one who had
          not before spoken, <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot bring myself
          to believe every thing I hear concerning their
          superstition.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ay,
          goldsmith,”</span> quoth the barber, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
          were always fond of having an opinion of your own; and, pray, what
          is it that you have had occasion to know about the <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Christians, more than the rest of us who
          hear you? If you mean that you have seen some of them die bravely
          in the Amphitheatre, why, that we have all heard of at least, and I
          think nobody disputes it.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“No,
          master barber,”</span> replied he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that is
          not what I was thinking of. I have seen your common thief-knave,
          when he knew he could do no better, brace you his nerves for the
          extremity, and die like a Hercules. I would rather judge of a man
          by his living than his dying.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“True,”</span> rejoins Virro; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and pray, what have you got to tell us about the life,
          then, of the Christians?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Not
          much,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you shall hear. My
          old mother (peace to her manes) was passing the Salarian one day
          last year, and there came by a hot-headed spark, driving four
          abreast in a chariot as fiercely as Nero in the Circus. He called
          out, that I believe, but the dame was deaf, and whether he tried to
          pull up, I know not, but the horses trod upon her as she fell.
          Another of the same sort came close behind, and I have been told
          they were running a race; but however that might be, on they both
          passed like a whirlwind, and my poor mother was left by herself
          among the flying dust. But the gods had mercy on her; they sent a
          kind heart to her aid. She was carried into one of the stateliest
          villas on that side of Tiber, and tended for six weeks by a noble
          lady, as if she had been not my mother, but her own; and this lady,
          friends—by Jove I suspected it not for long after—this lady was a
          Christian; but I shall not say how I found it out, nor would I
          mention the thing at all but among honest men. But where were these
          you spoke of taken?—I should like to know who they
          were.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“They were taken,”</span> said the stranger,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“not far from <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>the Appian Way, within one of the old
          monuments there,—a monument, it is said, of the
          Sempronii.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Of the
          Sempronii?”</span> cried the goldsmith, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Phœbus Apollo shield us!”</span> and from that moment
          he became as silent as hitherto he had been communicative.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The swarthy
          stranger, the silence yet continuing, arose from his seat, laid a
          piece of money upon the table, and moved towards the door. The
          barber also rose up, but he said to him, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sit still, I pray you, my friend;”</span> at the same
          time beckoning with his finger to the goldsmith, who, with a very
          dejected countenance, followed him into the street. What passed
          between them there, we perceived not; but the artificer re-entered
          not the chamber till some moments after we had heard the departing
          tread of the stranger’s horses. When he did come in again, he had
          the appearance of being in great confusion.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shortly after
          Sabinus reappeared, and bidding adieu to our tonsor, we walked with
          him towards the paternal mansion,—and we soon reached it; for, as I
          have already said, it was but a little way out from the
          village.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dwelling was
          modest enough, having no external ornament but a single portico,
          with a few statues ranged between its pillars. We entered by this
          portico, and found the feeble old man sitting by himself in an
          apartment immediately adjacent, wherein the beams of the moon,
          having partial access, were mingled with the subdued light of a
          painted lamp suspended from the ceiling. The father of my friend
          had all the appearance of sinking apace; yet he received me with an
          air, not of cheerfulness, but of kindness. The breeze found
          admission through the open pillars, and his countenance exhibited
          in its wan and faint lines the pleasure with which the coolness
          affected him. Beside him were placed baskets of roses, gathered
          from the abundance of his gardens. The young Vernæ, who from time
          to time brought in these flowers, came into the chamber with a
          decent appearance of sobriety and concern; but they were never long
          gone before we could hear them <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>laughing again at their play.—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Poor children,”</span> quoth the old man; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“why should they trouble themselves with thinking of
          the not remote victim of Orcus?”</span>—To which the Centurion
          replied, somewhat softening that loud and cheerful tone with which
          he was accustomed to address all persons—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Courage, my dear father, you must not speak so.
          Cerberus, I perceive, has only been making an ineffectual snap at
          you, and you will be growing younger after all this.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At which the old
          man shook his head, without any external sign of emotion, and
          replied, in a low monotonous voice,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Younger in the wrong way, my boy; for I become every
          day smaller in body, and feebler, and less able to do any thing to
          help myself. Nor am I unconscious that I have seen my due
          proportion of time. And yet, oh! fast sliding gentle brook, which I
          see between these paternal trees—I am still loath to exchange thee
          for Styx, and to lose the cheerful and sacred light of the sun and
          moon. I wish only I were once more able to repair with thy stream
          to the banks of father Tiber, that I might salute the good Emperor,
          who has been so kind to my son, and who would treat even an old
          broken-down, and long-retired soldier, like myself, with more
          favour than is to be expected from Rhadamanthus. As clouds let down
          their drops, so the many-peopled earth lets fall dismissed ghosts
          upon the Stygian shore.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While he was
          saying things in the same strain, an ancient Egyptian, who seemed
          to have the chief management of every thing, came into the chamber,
          and after desiring some of the boys to bring forth refreshments,
          took his place on a low stool by the foot of his master’s
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name=
          "Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>couch. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come, Tarna,”</span> said the Centurion, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what has become of all your philosophy? Why do you not
          inspire our friend with less of gloominess? Why is it that you do
          not bring out for his use some of those old stories, with which,
          when I was young, you were more willing to treat my ears than they
          were to attend?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nay,”</span> said the invalid, before the Egyptian
          could make any answer,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I liked well to
          listen to his Epicurean theories when I was able to walk about the
          fields; but now I would rather have him be silent. Do not trouble
          me any more, good Tarna, with any of your speeches. Allow me to
          believe as all my fathers did, and to contemplate not only the
          sepulchre in which their urns are placed, but the same dim regions
          in which many dear shades expect the greeting of a
          descendant.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To me,”</span> said the slave modestly, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it still seems, that by the rushing shower of atoms
          which moves every where through space, the mind is soothed, as by
          the sound of a great river carrying continually the watery
          offspring of the mountains into the bosom of ocean. The mind, sirs,
          appears to me to be calmed by the contemplation of infinity, even
          as the ear of an Egyptian sleeper is calmed by the eternal music of
          rolling Nilus. It mingles itself with that which it contemplates;
          it perceives—it feels itself to be a liquid part of that vast
          endless stream of universal being: a part which has been casually
          arrested and detained, but which will soon mingle again and be
          scattered away in a thousand fragments, to wander, no one knows
          whither, through the great all-receiving void—not to lose
          existence, for in that my dear master entirely <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>misunderstands me—but to cease from
          feeling as a Sabinus, or a Tarna.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man kept
          regarding his Egyptian with a placid smile; but I could not help
          interposing: <span class="tei tei-q">“What is this you have said?
          Do you assert that I can cease to be Valerius, to feel as Valerius,
          and yet not lose my existence? Can I <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">be</span></span>, and
          yet not be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">myself</span></span>?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Most easily,”</span> replied he; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the divided fragments may move about for a thousand
          years, before it befall any of them to be stopped in some future
          combination of atoms. These, it is manifest, only tremble and
          suffer when they form part of a soul, but are immediately released
          from all pain or mischance, when this confinement and cohesion are
          at an end, and they, being dispersed, regain liberty and wander
          about singly, as of yore; for, as our great dispeller of delusion
          says—When death is, we are not. If, therefore, Sabinus shrinks from
          the fear of death, it is an idle fear. Does he not perceive that
          when death arrives, Sabinus is no longer to be found. Whatever its
          effects may be, they must affect not him, but an army of
          innumerable disjointed essences, in no one of which could he by any
          means be able to recognize himself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To make a short story out of a very long one,”</span>
          interrupted the Centurion; <span class="tei tei-q">“life, you
          think, is not worthy of the name of existence—that being so, it is
          no wonder you should think lightly of death.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Mistake me not,”</span> quoth the sage; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“no—life <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">is</span></span> existence; I not only admit
          that, but I assert that it is the business of every man, and the
          sole true object of wisdom, to render life, while it endures,
          pleasant. Earthly pleasure consists in a bland juxta-position of
          atoms <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name=
          "Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>necessarily, though
          not permanently, connected; the removal of pain implies that
          quiescence which pervades the nobleness of the unenclosed
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span>. To exist in this
          shape, we are compelled; it is our business to render our existence
          as near an approach to felicity as we may.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Fill your cup, Tarna,”</span> quoth the Centurion;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am no great philosopher, yet methinks I
          can see the drift of this part of your story. Fill up your goblet,
          most venerable Epicurean, and see (if it be not below your
          dignity,) whether the atoms, which, by a fortuitous and temporary
          juxta-position have formed your throat, will not feel their corners
          very philosophically softened by the rushing of a little rivulet of
          good Falernian—one cup of which, saving your presence, I hold to be
          more worthy of wetting my guttural atoms, than all the water that
          ever sported its music between Memphis and Alexandria.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the slave
          and the Centurion were thus discoursing, the old man appeared to
          taste, as it were, the pleasure of a renovated existence, in
          contemplating the brown health and strong muscular fabric of the
          inheritor of his name. The hearty masculine laugh with which my
          friend usually concluded his observations, was, I take leave to
          think, richer music to his ears than ever Egyptian heard in the
          dark rollings of the Nile, or Epicurean dreamt of in the airy dance
          of atoms. I suspect he was more reconciled to the inevitable stroke
          of fate, by considering that he was to leave such a representative
          behind him, than by any argument which his own superstition, or the
          philosophy of his attendant, could suggest. In return for this
          obvious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg
          254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>admiration, the Centurion, without question,
          manifested every symptom of genuine affection. Yet, I think, the
          instinctive consciousness of his own strength made the piety of the
          robust son assume an air more approaching to that of patronage,
          than might have been altogether becoming. If such a fault there
          were, however, it escaped the notice of the invalid, who continued,
          till Tarna insisted upon his retiring, to gaze upon my friend, and
          listen to his remarks, with looks of exultation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion
          withdrew with his father, so that I was left alone with Tarna for
          some time; and it was then that, in my juvenile simplicity, I could
          not help expressing my surprise at finding in servile condition a
          man possessed of such acquirements as his, and addicted to such
          pursuits.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It would argue little,”</span> he replied,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in favour of such pursuits, if they tended
          only to make me repine at the place which has been allotted me—no
          matter whether by the decree of fate, or the caprice of fortune.
          And after all, I am not of opinion that any such external
          circumstances can much affect the real happiness of any one. Give
          to him that has been born a slave, what men are pleased to call his
          freedom; in a few weeks he will become so much accustomed to the
          boon, that he will cease to think of it. Heap wealth upon him; to
          wealth also he will gradually become habituated. Rank—power—with
          all it is the same. It is in the mind only that the seat of
          happiness is placed; and there it never can be, unless in
          companionship with thoughts that look down upon, and despise being
          affected by trifling things.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"

          "tei tei-q">“but ere you remain long in the city, you will meet
          with not a few, philosophers only in the name, who, having small
          means of subsistence, but being desirous of leading a luxurious and
          agreeable life, become teachers of such doctrines as may accord
          best with the vicious inclinations of those who are most likely to
          entertain them. These persons assume too often the name of
          Epicureans. They are seen every where at feasts crowned with
          myrtle, and fawning upon gouty senators; and whenever a boar’s-head
          appears, they are sure to call it worthy of Meleager. Their
          conversation is made up of stale jests about Charon and his boat,
          and the taking of Auguries; and, when finally inebriated, they roll
          upon the ground like those animals, to whom, in consequence of the
          proceedings of such hypocritical pretenders, the ignorant have
          dared too often to liken the wisest of mankind. Such things I
          disdain—I am satisfied to remain, as I was born, in the rank of
          Æsop, Epictetus, Terence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time the
          Centurion had returned. He had a lamp in his hand; and he
          interrupted our conversation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, we
          start betimes, Caius; and you too, my sweet cock of Cyrene, I think
          you had better fold your wings, and compose yourself upon your
          roost.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oh, enviable
          temperament! said I to myself—you liken the slave to a bird.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I was in bed
          before Dromo interrupted my reflections by saying, in a low tone of
          considerable confidence, <span class="tei tei-q">“And now, Master
          Valerius, do you still continue, as much as two days ago, to
          disbelieve in philtres and despise enchantresses? You see what,
          with all my precaution, has come of this connection between
          Rubellia and the Neapolitan.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In truth, Dromo,”</span> I replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it is visible that Pona had some share in leading the
          soldiers to the Sempronian Sepulchre; but I am doubtful if that had
          any thing to do with the private affairs of the lady Rubellia. As
          to that matter, I confess myself entirely in the
          dark.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Dark indeed,”</span> quoth
          he, <span class="tei tei-q">“must your observation have been, if
          you have yet to learn that, but for that accursed witch, nothing of
          all this had befallen; but if there be an edict against the
          Christians, there are twenty laws against sorcery; and that both
          Pona and she that consulted her shall know well ere long, if they
          do not as yet know it; or may Cretan change places with
          Bœotian!”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Say on, good
          Dromo,”</span> I replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am all ears;
          and as you appear to have been all eyes, I shall probably soon be
          more enlightened.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> quoth he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
          glad to find that you are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg
          258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
          a mood to listen to me decently. You remember where I took my
          station when you mounted those unfortunate steps upon the tower. I
          had not stood there many minutes before I heard somebody
          approaching; and having no doubt it was Rubellia, I was preparing
          myself for giving her such a salutation as I thought would put a
          speedy end to her wandering for that night. On came the steps, but
          no Rubellia. No; it was Xerophrastes himself; and although he had
          laid aside the Greek mantle, and donned a boatman’s black cloak for
          the nonce, I promise you I knew his stately gait well enough
          beneath all these new trappings. It was no part of my job, however,
          to attempt frightening the stoic.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And so you let him pass without doing any
          thing?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I did; I confess I gave one
          or two groans after he had gone on a few paces, but I did not
          observe him much quicken his walk, and I believe, to do the man
          justice, he set it all down to the wind rustling among the trees.
          But I thought not much of him at all, to speak the truth; for, said
          I to myself, Well, if it be as I have suspected for these two
          blessed days, and this master long-beard is really in league with
          the widow, the chances are, she herself is not far behind him. I
          lay by, therefore, and expected in silence till I should hear
          another tread; and in the meantime I spoke to you once or twice
          across the path, but you made me no answer, for which you know your
          own reasons.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“The reason,”</span>
          said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“was a very simple one, I assure
          you. I had fallen asleep, and no wonder, for you know how long I
          had been a watcher.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span>
          said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I guessed as much, and it was
          nothing but the born tenderness of my dispo<span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>sition, which made me cease from offering you
          any disturbance. I thought I should surely be enough single-handed
          for the widow; and besides, in case of need, I knew your waking
          would always be in my power.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Admirably reasoned, Dromo,”</span> said I;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and so it seems no need came, for you
          certainly never awakened me; for which I may thank the bonds from
          which the Centurion’s kindness has just set me free. But you have
          atoned abundantly—I pray you, get on with your tale.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Presently,”</span> he resumed, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I heard footsteps, indeed, my good master, and not
          footsteps alone, but voices; and I moved from the place as hastily
          as I could, till I came to a tree, the branches of which, springing
          low on the trunk, offered an opportunity for mounting, which I
          should have been a Bœotian indeed had I neglected. I mounted, and
          hiding myself as well as I could among the boughs, awaited the
          arrival of the party, which consisted—ay, stare if you will—of
          Xerophrastes and the widow, walking in front, in earnest talk by
          themselves,—and the Neapolitan in the rear. They halted, and though
          they spoke low, I could hear them distinctly.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And what, in the name of Heaven, said
          they?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘Are you sure,’</span> said
          the widow, <span class="tei tei-q">‘that this is indeed the girl
          whom Sextus went to see at the Villa? Can there be no
          mistake?’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Mistake, lady, there is
          none,’</span> replied the Stoic. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Pona was
          at the villa with her basket, and she saw them all walking together
          in the garden.’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘And this little
          Christian,’</span> said the lady as if to herself, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘it is she that has cost me all this <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trouble! It is for this Athanasia that I
          have been insulted as never woman was by man, and they are both
          here in the tower!’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘They are,
          lady,’</span> quoth the witch; <span class="tei tei-q">‘they are
          both in the tower, for I saw her go in by her self first, and then
          in went some dozen of those muffled blasphemers, and, last of all,
          went in he himself. I saw him not enter indeed, but I swear to you,
          that I saw him here not twenty paces from hence, and he had with
          him that cunning slave of his, (meaning myself, sir,) whose ugly
          face, (the foul woman added,) I would know although it were
          disguised beneath all the washes that were ever mixed in the
          seething-pots of Calabria.’</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">‘But
          what,’</span> interrupted our long-beard, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘what will Licinius say? At least, my lady and my
          friend Pona will take good care that no suspicion rests upon me.
          Sextus is a silly boy, without taste, judgment, or discretion; but
          Licinius is acute and powerful.’</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Fear not,’</span> said Rubellia; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘fear not, dear Xerophrastes. Nobody shall appear in
          the matter except Pona, and she tells you she has already given
          warning at the Capene Gate. There are always a hundred men
          stationed on the Cœlian. Nothing can save them!’</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“These words were scarcely out of her mouth, ere the
          soldiers were heard approaching. Xerophrastes ascended with great
          agility a tree just over against mine; Rubellia retreated among the
          pines; and Pona alone awaited the guard. I would have periled a
          limb to have been able to give you the alarm; but little did I
          suspect, that had I sought you where I left you, I should have
          sought in vain.—How, I pray you, did you contrive to get into the
          accursed tower?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I told him I
          should give him the story another time <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a>at full length, and mentioned briefly what had
          occurred. And then the Cretan proceeded with his narrative.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I leave you to guess, Valerius, how my heart beat when
          I saw the witch lead the soldiers straight to the place where I
          supposed you were still sitting—with what anxiety I saw the tower
          surrounded—its tenants brought out,—with what astonishment I saw
          you led out, the last of their number.—I had neither time to think
          by what means all this had happened, nor the least power to
          interfere. I saw you all mounted—guarded—borne away. Whither they
          carried you, I was unable to make the smallest conjecture. I saw
          Sabinus speak to you, and then I had hope,—but that too failed. In
          brief, I did not venture from my tree till the whole assembly, not
          forgetting Xerophrastes, had departed; and you may judge what a
          story I had to tell Sextus when I reached home.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Instead of waiting to ponder and hesitate, as he used
          to do when his own matters perplexed him, he went from me straight
          to his father. But before they had done with their conversation,
          Sabinus himself arrived, and he was immediately taken into the same
          chamber where they were. Licinius and he went out together soon
          afterwards, and I think they walked towards the Palatine; but
          whithersoever they went, they had a good deal of work before them,
          for the day had advanced considerably before they returned. The
          Centurion’s horses were brought to the door shortly after; my
          master desired me to accompany him; and gave me letters for you,
          which I had almost forgotten to deliver.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the
          story of the faithful Cretan. The letter of Licinius I have still
          preserved:—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Since our Sabinus desires that I should write to you,
          although his own kindness renders it unnecessary that I should do
          so, I cannot refuse. I understand little, my Valerius, of what has
          brought you into this condition, from which, not without difficulty
          overcome, you are, notwithstanding, speedily to be delivered. I
          guess, that hastiness of various sorts, not, however, entirely
          without excuse in a person of your age, has been the means of
          implicating you in the affairs of a sect, equally unworthy of your
          communication, whether you consider the country in which their
          superstition originated, or the barbarities with which it is
          stained. But even for beauty, my young friend, it becomes not a
          Roman, least of all a Valerius, to forget what is due to the laws
          of Rome, and the will of the Prince. Consider with yourself how
          nearly you have escaped serious evil. Return to us, and forget what
          has passed, except for the lesson it must teach you. Of Rubellia
          and Xerophrastes I am unwilling to believe, without farther
          examination, what has been told me by my slave Dromo. We shall
          speak of that and other matters, when (which I hope will be early
          to-morrow) you once more give me the pleasure of seeing you. I have

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Day was far
          advanced before the Centurion and myself once more drew near to the
          city. When we reached the first declivity beyond the Anio, the sun
          was about to sink behind the Janicular. The innumerable sounds of
          the capital, blended together into one mighty whisper, seemed only
          to form part of the natural music of the air, and might almost have
          been confounded with the universal hum of insects. We rode slowly
          down the hill, the base of which is ever darkened by the solemn
          groves of the Appian.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We advanced in
          silence through that region of melancholy magnificence. I scarcely
          knew whether I should be able of myself to recognize, among so many
          similar edifices, the mausoleum of the Sempronii, and some feeling
          rendered me unwilling to put any questions concerning it to
          Sabinus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while we
          were moving leisurely, we heard of a sudden a clang of cymbals
          among the trees, a little to the right hand, and the Centurion,
          saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“What company can this be?”</span>
          led the way down a narrow path branching from the main road. This
          path was winding and dusky, being edged on either side with
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name=
          "Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pines and cypresses,
          so that for some space we saw nothing; and the cymbals having
          ceased again, the Centurion said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          suppose it is some funeral; they have probably completed every
          thing, and have seen out the last gleam among the embers. Let us
          get on, for perhaps we may be kept back by their procession, if
          they are already returning.”</span> We quickened our pace
          accordingly, till a sharp turning of the road discovered to us a
          great number of persons who were standing silent, as if in
          contemplation of some ceremony. Several persons on horseback
          seemed, like ourselves, to have had their progress interrupted; but
          they were sitting quietly, and making no complaint. The silence of
          the whole assembly was indeed such, that Sabinus motioned to me to
          ask no questions, adding, in a whisper, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Take off your cap; it is some religious rite—every
          body is uncovered.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion,
          however, was not a person to be stopped thus, without wishing to
          understand farther the cause of the interruption. The one side of
          the road was guarded by a high wall, to the top of which a number
          of juvenile spectators had climbed;—the other by a ditch of great
          breadth, and full of water, beyond which was a grove of trees; and
          I saw him eyeing the ditch, as if considering whether, by passing
          it, it might not be possible, without disturbing the crowd, to get
          nearer the object of their attention, or at least to make progress
          in our journey. At last he beckoned to me to follow him, and the
          bold equestrian at one leap passed easily. I imitated the example,
          and so did the Prætorian soldier, his attendant, who had now come
          up to us; but as for Dromo, he was obliged to remain
          behind.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ere we reached
          the bottom of the declivity, I perceived that we had come close to
          the Sempronian monument, and that the ceremony, whatever it might
          be, was taking place in front of the tower. We gave our horses to
          the soldier, and contrived to gain the bank over against it—the
          same place, in fact, where the Cretan slave had taken his station
          among the pine-trees, on the night when all those things occurred
          of which I have spoken to you. Like him, we placed ourselves as
          quietly as we could behind the trees, and, indeed, for our purpose,
          there could have been no better situation. We were contented,
          however, to occupy it as much as possible without attracting
          observation; for it was evident, in spite of the curiosity that
          detained so great a multitude near at hand, there must be something
          mysterious or ominous of nature in that which was taking place,
          since not one of the crowd had dared to come forward, so as to be
          within hearing of the officiators.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And these,
          indeed, were a melancholy group. For men, and women, and children
          of every age, to the number it may be of an hundred, appeared all
          standing together in garments of black; while, in the midst of
          them, and immediately by the base of the tower, two or three veiled
          priests, with their necessary assistants, seemed to be preparing
          for sacrifice a black bull, whose hoofs spurned the dust as they
          held him, and his gilded horns glittered in the light of the
          declining sun. Sabinus no sooner discovered the arrangement of the
          solemn company, than he whispered to me, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Be sure, these are all the kindred of the Sempronii.
          Without question they have come to purify the mausoleum, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name=
          "Pg266" id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to avert the
          vengeance of the violated Manes. Behold,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that stately figure, close to the head of
          the animal on the right hand; that, I know, is Marcia Sempronia,
          Priestess of Apollo. Without doubt, these by her are her
          brothers.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Some of her near relations they must be,”</span> I
          made answer; <span class="tei tei-q">“for observe you that girl
          whose face is wrapped in her mourning veil, and whose sobs are
          audible through all its folds? I had one glimpse of her
          countenance, and I am sure it is young Sempronia, the cousin and
          companion of Athanasia,—the daughter of Lucius the
          senator.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Poor girl,”</span> replied Sabinus, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“from my heart I pity her. They are all joining hands,
          that the nearest of the kindred touching the priest, his deed may
          appear manifestly to be the deed of all.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment,
          one of the officiators sounded a few mournful notes upon a trumpet.
          The priest who held the axe, clave at one blow the front of the
          bull. The blood streamed, and wine streamed with it abundantly upon
          the base of the mausoleum; and then, while we were yet gazing on
          the convulsions of the animal, the trumpet sounded a second time,
          and the whole company sung together, the priest leading them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The shadows of
          the tower and of the pine trees lay strongly upon them, and I
          thought there was something of a very strange contrast between the
          company and their chant, on the one hand, and the beautiful
          sculptures, full of all the emblems of life and happiness, on the
          other, with which, according to the gay dreams of Grecian fancy,
          the walls of the funereal edifice itself had here and there been
          garnished. Fauns, and torch-<span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a>bearing nymphs, and children crowned with
          garlands, and wreathed groups and fantastic dances, seemed to
          enliven almost to mockery the monumental marbles; but one felt the
          real gloominess both of death and of superstition, in the attitudes
          and accents of the worshippers. It was thus they sung:—</p>

          sung, as I have said, by the whole of this kindred there assembled
          together; the first part of them distinctly, though not loudly; but
          the last verses in a note so low, that no one, unless quite near,
          (like ourselves,) could have comprehended their meaning. But as for
          the young Sempronia, when they came to that part of the chant in
          which reference was so particularly made to Athanasia, not only did
          her lips refuse to join in the words, but her agitation was such
          that I thought the poor maiden would have screamed <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>outright, had she not been controlled by
          the eye, and the hand also, of her aunt the Priestess. Sobs,
          however, and low hysterical groans, could not be stifled; and at
          last so great was her agony, that even the haughty Priestess was
          compelled to give way to it.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Bring water,”</span> said she; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“dash ye water upon the foolish thing: methinks it
          seems almost as if she had partaken in the frenzy of her
          unhappy——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And before she
          could finish the sentence, one or two of the females that were
          present did take hold of Sempronia, and began, seeing there was no
          water nearer at hand, to bear her slender form towards the small
          stream of which I have already spoken, and which flowed immediately
          behind the clump of pine trees, amongst which the Centurion and I
          were standing.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She was quite
          passive in their hands; and they dragged her without resistance or
          difficulty to the place where we were standing; but they could not
          pass without seeing us: and no sooner did the eyes of Sempronia
          fall upon me, than she burst by one unexpected effort from the arms
          of those that were sustaining her, and ere I or any one could
          suspect what she was to do, there lay she at my feet, clinging with
          her arms around my knees. <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh,
          Valerius,”</span> said she—<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, dear
          Valerius, they curse Athanasia! Where is my Athanasia? whither have
          they taken her? Oh, tell me, that I may go to her—that I may go to
          comfort Athanasia!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace!”</span> said, before I could answer, the
          Priestess of Apollo—<span class="tei tei-q">“Peace, mad, wretched
          thing,—has infatuation blasted the whole of our line?”</span> And
          she seized Sempronia by the arm, and compelled her to spring from
          her knees. But the maiden still clung by her <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hands to me, and continued, with looks
          and words of misery, to demand from me that knowledge which, alas!
          I would myself have given so much to possess. Sabinus, however,
          smote me on the shoulder, as if to make me recollect myself; and I
          had resolution enough not to betray the feelings with which I
          listened to Sempronia’s frantic supplication.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What is this, sir?”</span> then said the
          Priestess—<span class="tei tei-q">“What is it that you know of
          Athanasia? and why is it that you have presumed to witness the
          secret sacrifice of a noble race?—Speak—or is there no meaning in
          this poor girl’s frenzy? And yet, methinks I have seen you before,
          and that, too, in the presence of——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It was,”</span> said I, hastily—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“it was indeed in the presence of Athanasia; but that
          circumstance, if you please to remember, was altogether accidental.
          I was with the lady Rubellia when you found her in the Temple of
          Apollo——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“it was
          that same day when she refused to name the name of Phœbus in his
          own precincts! Ha! little did I imagine what thoughts were in her
          breast—else might we at least have been spared this open
          degradation. And yet you, methinks, saluted Athanasia.—What is your
          name, sir?—Know you, in truth, whither the lady Athanasia has been
          conveyed?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He was with her!—he was with her!”</span> exclaimed
          Sempronia,—<span class="tei tei-q">“he was with her in the tower
          when the soldiers came.—O Valerius! tell me where she is now,—into
          what dungeon have they cast my friend—my sister——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ha!”</span> quoth the Priestess, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he was with her in the
          tower!—Romans—kinsmen—Lucius—Marcus—hear <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>ye this? I charge ye, seize upon this
          treacherous blasphemer!—It is he that has deceived Athanasia; and
          now must he come here to taint the smoke of our sacrifice, and
          pollute our prayers with his presence.—Seize him!”</span>—And she
          herself grasped my cloak as she spake—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Seize, I charge ye, this accursed
          Christian!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Sabinus,
          when he saw the Priestess thus furious, stept forward, and said to
          her kinsmen, who were standing in perplexity behind her,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sirs, I beseech you, be not you also
          carried away with this madness.—My friend here knows nothing of the
          lady Athanasia, except that she was borne away by soldiers from the
          very place where we are standing. I myself witnessed it also, being
          here with the Prætorians. Valerius is no more a Christian than she
          who accuses him.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I know not, sirs, how we are to understand all
          this,”</span> said one of the Sempronii, in a calm voice.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Is this young man the same Valerius who is
          living in the house of Licinius?—Yet it must be he. I have been
          with Licinius this very day; and if this be he, whatever he may
          have known before, I am sure he knows nothing of where Athanasia is
          now,—and, sister, I am well assured he is no Christian.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is the same, sir,”</span> said Sabinus.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He is the same Caius Valerius of whom you
          spake, and I am Sabinus, a Centurion of the Prætorians.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We have all heard of your name,”</span> said
          Sempronius, respectfully; <span class="tei tei-q">“I perceive there
          is some mistake in all this matter. If it please you, let us walk
          aside, and understand each other.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So saying, he
          withdrew Sabinus to a little distance, and beckoned to me to
          accompany him. <span class="tei tei-q">“Valerius,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name=
          "Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>said the old man,
          when he perceived that we were out of hearing, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I crave you, in the first place, to forget all this
          trouble which has been occasioned to you by the violence of my
          daughter, on the one hand, and of my sister on the other. They are
          women; and, for different reasons, the violence of both is
          excusable. I have been for a considerable part of this day with
          Licinius, and have heard from him enough to satisfy me how
          guiltlessly you yourself have been involved in this affair; and
          your speedy liberation from confinement is more than enough to
          confirm my belief of all that he said. Yet there is much which I do
          not understand. I pray you speak openly, and fear nothing—you have,
          indeed, nothing to fear. Was it in consequence of any private
          meeting with my niece—nay, I mean not to suspect you of any thing
          amiss—in one word, how was it that you happened to be taken into
          custody with that unhappy girl?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> I replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
          are a noble Roman, and the near kinsman of Athanasia. You have a
          right to put these questions, and whatever reluctance I may have to
          overcome, I feel that I have no right to refuse an answer.”</span>
          And so I told Sempronius, plainly and distinctly, the story both of
          my unwilling entrance into the mausoleum, and of my forcible
          abduction from it. In short, I saw no reason to conceal any thing
          from the person who was most likely to be able to serve Athanasia,
          if any thing to serve her were possible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is well,”</span> he said; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you speak as becomes a man of the Valerian blood. But
          as for poor Athanasia, I swear to you I cannot yet bring myself to
          believe that she hath in reality been privy to such things as have
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name=
          "Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>been discovered
          concerning these Christians.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Discovered!”</span> said I. <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          pray you, what has been discovered concerning them? If you allude
          to any of the wild stories that are circulated about their
          religion, you may depend upon it, it is all mere madness to believe
          a word of it. I have read in their sacred books myself, and I swear
          to you, that, so far as I have seen, nothing can be more simple,
          benign, humane, than the morality inculcated by their
          leader.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Young man,”</span> he answered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I was not thinking of their creed, which, for aught I
          know or care, may be sublime enough; for there was always a
          mysterious sort of philosophy current among those old Asiatic
          nations. But I speak of the designs of these men; in one word, I
          speak of their conspiracy.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Conspiracy!—What? How? Against whom? I will pledge my
          life, no conspiracy was sheltered beneath yon tower that night. I
          swear to you, they are simple people, and were thinking of nothing
          but their worship.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Worship!”</span> quoth he; <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          promise you it will not be so easy to persuade me that Cotilius has
          suddenly become a man of so much piety, either to our gods, or to
          the deities (if they have any) of the Christians.—What, Cotilius?
          By Jove, Rome does not hold at this moment a more bold, daring,
          godless rascal. You may as soon try to make me believe that
          Capaneus came to Thebes with a hymn in his mouth. No, no—the sworn
          friend of Domitian will not easily gain credit for his new-sprung
          sanctity.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Cotilius? That was the
          very name of the man that seized me, as I have told
          you.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I should have guessed as
          much,”</span> said he;—<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, I promise you,
          how little soever Athanasia might have known, secrets they had;
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name=
          "Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and Cotilius was well
          aware at what peril they should be revealed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The late example,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“must indeed have alarmed him.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you
          speak of that fanatic Syrian? You know little of Cotilius. No,
          no—had the worst of his fears been the necessity to worship all the
          deities between Euphrates and Rhine, he would have slept
          soundly.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“But surely,”</span> said
          I, <span class="tei tei-q">“you do not believe that Athanasia had
          any knowledge of the man’s secret designs, if he had any. He may
          have used Christianity, or desired to use it, as a weapon against
          the State; but be certain, neither she nor any of those really
          attached to their religion, had any notion of his
          purpose.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It may be so, indeed,”</span> he
          answered;—<span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven grant it may. As for
          Cotilius, I will speak to you more at length of him anon. I will
          bid adieu to my sister, and take order about my daughter; and then,
          if it so please you, we shall walk together to the
          city.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this I
          agreed, but Sabinus rode on to the camp of the Prætorians. He
          whispered to me, however, that unless he were most necessarily
          detained, he should be, ere long, at the house of Licinius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To you,”</span> said the Senator, as we went on,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“who have so lately come from your island,
          the whole of this expiatory spectacle is probably quite new; but I
          am sure Sabinus could not have been aware what was its purpose,
          otherwise he would not have been guilty of so grievously offending
          the feelings of my sister, and some of the rest of my kindred, by
          remaining a witness of these most private rites. The Priestess is
          indeed inconsolable, and her grief has set half her other passions
          in motion like<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg
          275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>wise. Athanasia was as dear to her as if she
          had been her daughter; so, in truth, she was to us all, ever since
          her parents died. But Cotilius, this knave Cotilius, has, I fear,
          blasted her hopes and ours.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“It
          occurs to me,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“and I should
          have mentioned it to you before, that there seemed to be no great
          understanding between this Cotilius and Athanasia. She was
          evidently displeased with many things he both said and did; and he,
          on his part, did not appear to relish her
          interference.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“True,”</span> he
          continued, <span class="tei tei-q">“you have already hinted as
          much; and I assure you, these are some of the circumstances in the
          whole case that tend most to excite my hopes. Great Heavens! what
          would Caius have said had he dreamt that his orphan was to be
          suspected of having sympathy with any of the dark designs of that
          shame to Roman knighthood! But you, of course, are a stranger to
          this man’s history.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“With its end,
          at least,”</span> I replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is like we
          may all be soon enough acquainted.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven
          grant we have not cause too deeply to remember it! but I have known
          him from the beginning. I told you already that he was in great
          favour with Domitian.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“And the
          reverse, of course,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“both
          with Nerva and Trajan.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Even so,”</span> he continued, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and with reason; for in all the disturbances which
          occurred on the accession of the last sovereign, and, in
          particular, in those foul intrigues among the Prætorians, which at
          one time brought Nerva’s own life into immediate danger and
          compelled him to bare his neck to the soldiery at his gate, this
          Cotilius was more than suspected to have had a deep concern. When
          Petronius and Par<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg
          276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class=

          href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          hacked in pieces, it needed no great witchcraft to detect some of
          the moving spirits that produced their catastrophe; but proof there
          was none at the time; and even had there been proof enough, the
          good old man would have been too timid to act upon it. These
          things, however, could not be forgotten either by Nerva or his
          successor. Hitherto, the strong hand has repressed every rebellious
          motion; but be sure that no man ever lived more an object of
          suspicion, than this man has done ever since Nerva adopted
          Trajan.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And you think,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that, among other intrigues, it had occurred to this
          man to make his own use of the Christians; despised and persecuted
          though they be, there can, indeed, be no doubt that their numbers
          are considerable, and that their faith is a strong bond of
          cohesion.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“It is even so,”</span> said the Senator. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But as yet the treason even of Cotilius rests on
          suspicion only, and report; and, after all, even if he were proved
          guilty of having nourished such schemes, the account you give of
          what you saw and heard at their assembly, inspires me with
          considerable doubts whether he can be supposed to have ever as yet
          ventured to invite their participation;—unless, indeed, they
          practised deception while you were with them. The moment I heard of
          what had happened, I went to the Palatine, in hopes of <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>attaining either assistance from
          Urbicus, or mercy, if that were all we could look for, from Trajan.
          But Urbicus could give me no satisfaction, except that my niece was
          in a solitary and safe place. The charges, he said, against one of
          the leaders (he meant Cotilius) were heavy; and until these were
          sifted, it was impossible that access could be afforded to any one
          who had been thrown into confinement. The Emperor had shewn unusual
          symptoms of anxiety, and had even, so he hinted, been in person
          investigating the matter at a distance from the city, during great
          part of the preceding night and day. To tell you the truth,
          Valerius, till this thing fell out, I was wont to consider the new
          violence about the Christians as somewhat unworthy of the enlarged
          intellect of Trajan: it had not occurred to me, how easily the
          resources of such a superstition might be enlisted in the cause of
          discontent.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of course,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“nothing will be done in regard to Athanasia until all
          circumstances have been examined.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Done!”</span> said he; <span class="tei tei-q">“has
          not enough been done already to justify almost in a man more than
          you have seen among our women? Has not a whole family been
          disgraced? Has not the mausoleum of their fathers been prostituted
          for the unholy purposes of this barbarian sect? If the Senate
          should be summoned, with what countenance should I shew myself
          among my friends?—Unhappy girl! How little did she know in what
          trouble she was to involve those that love her the
          best.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time we
          had come within sight of the house of Licinius, and the Senator
          took leave, with a promise that I should see him on the
          morrow.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I found Sextus
          alone in his chamber, where he embraced me with all the ardour of
          juvenile affection. <span class="tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“my dear Caius, at any other time I might
          have found fault with you for taking so great a part in my griefs,
          and yet keeping so many of your own to yourself. But if it be
          indeed as Sempronia has said, I should be a strange friend to
          choose this hour for complaining of such trifles as regard only
          myself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          only time to say, that the misfortune of Athanasia was communicated
          to Sempronia almost immediately, by an old freedwoman, who had been
          in the habit of attending her when she went from home in secret,
          and who, going to the mausoleum to accompany her on her return,
          arrived there just in time to see what befel her. She saw you also,
          (how she knew who you were, I know not,) and when she had told her
          story to Sempronia, the poor girl, before speaking even with her
          father, sent for me to come to her in the gardens. I did so; all
          that passed I need not repeat; but I hope my advice was the right
          one. At all events, I acted for the best, and my father, who is now
          aware of every thing, seemed to approve of what I had done. O
          Valerius! were Athanasia free, and you happy, many things have
          occurred to make me much more at ease than when you left us. My
          father is evidently shocked with what Dromo told about Rubellia;
          and as for Xerophrastes, he had not once spoken to him either
          yesterday or to-day. Indeed, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>neither of them have been much here. My father
          is continually exerting himself concerning Athanasia; and
          Xerophrastes, I suppose, is afraid of a discovery. As for me, I am
          sorry I must leave you, for I promised to meet Sempronia; and
          although I have nothing to tell her, I cannot fail in my
          appointment. She must have returned before this time from the
          mausoleum, where an expiatory sacrifice was to be made at
          sunset.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sabinus by this
          time had hastened to me once more, according to his kind promise. I
          told him that my kinsman was not at home, and that I proposed, in
          the meantime, accompanying his son a part of the way towards the
          Suburban of Capito. The Centurion insisted on going with us,
          saying, that he could not think of returning to the camp without
          having spoken with Licinius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion,
          in virtue of his office, had free access to the gardens of Trajan;
          so he led us by both a more delightful and a nearer path towards
          the Salarean Gate. Young Sextus then quitted us; and we returned
          slowly through the beautiful groves of the Imperial Villa, in hopes
          of finding my kinsman by the time we should reach his mansion. But
          as we were walking very quietly along one of the broad green
          terraces, we heard voices in an adjoining alley, separated from us
          by luxuriant thickets of myrtle, and Sabinus, whispering to me,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Hush, let us see what we have got
          here,”</span> insinuated himself with great dexterity among the
          verdant shrubs. I followed him with as little noise as was
          possible, and having found a convenient peeping place, we soon
          perceived two figures at some little distance from us in the
          moonlight.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Come, Sabinus,”</span> I
          whispered, <span class="tei tei-q">“they are lovers perhaps—I don’t
          see what right we have to overhear.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace,”</span> quoth he, <span class="tei tei-q">“if
          you stir, they will detect us, and it is nothing unless it be
          known.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With some
          reluctance I remained where I was; but my scruples were at an end
          the moment I perceived who they were.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Most noble, most illustrious lady,”</span> said
          Xerophrastes, <span class="tei tei-q">“this matter has indeed been
          conducted unfortunately, yet no reason see I why you should give
          way to so many groundless apprehensions. The only thing, after all,
          that you have lost, if indeed you have lost it, is the good opinion
          of Licinius; for, as to that foolish boy——”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Name him not,”</span> replied Rubellia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“name not the stripling. Surely madness alone can
          account for my behaviour.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Madness!”</span> quoth the Stoic; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“yes, truly, and who, at certain moments, is free from
          such madness? As Euripides has expressed it, Venus, if she come in
          wisdom, is the wisest; if otherwise, the most frenzied of
          influences. The greatest have not been exempt from such
          visitations. Banish it from your heart, noble lady, or replace it
          by something more worthy of your discernment. There is, I think,
          but one pair of eyes in Rome that could have been blind to such
          perfections.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“O
          Xerophrastes!”</span> said she, <span class="tei tei-q">“speak not
          to me of perfections. Alas! I was born under a deceitful star—a
          star of apparent splendour and real misery.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Noble lady,”</span> he replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I swear to you that what tincture of philosophy I have
          imbibed, is unable to sustain my serenity when I hear such words
          from your lips. You are surrounded by all that externals can
          minister. It is your part to compose your mind, and then how should
          it be possible for you to taste of unhappiness? Think no more of
          that boy.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The philosopher
          took her hand with an air of the deepest sympathy, and at the same
          time drew the end of his mantle over his face, as if to conceal the
          extent of his participation in her distresses.—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas! lady, this is, after all, a miserable world.
          There is no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg
          282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>rest but in the affections, and behold how
          they are harassed on every hand by the invidious accidents of life.
          Philosophy proclaims her antidote, but the poison is every where;
          and it is all one course of being wounded to be cured, and being
          cured only to be more easily wounded again.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our friend
          continued in an attitude of pensive contemplation. The moonbeams
          fell full on his high brow and the large massy features of his
          countenance, and on the robust limbs which emerged from below the
          stately folds of his mantle; and I could not help thinking that
          there was something almost heroic, which I had never before
          remarked, in the whole of his appearance. Rubellia kept her eyes
          fixed steadfastly upon him.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I should have known nothing of it,”</span> he resumed,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“had I never deserted my paternal valley
          for the vain pleasures of Athens, and the magnificence of
          Rome.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“You repent,”</span> said
          she, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you ever visited Italy? I pray
          you deal with me openly. If it be your wish to leave Rome, speak,
          and I shall put it in your power to retire to Greece as handsomely
          as you could ever have hoped to do from the family of Licinius. Of
          wealth, as you well know, I have enough both for myself and for my
          faithful friends, among whom, be sure, I place you in the first
          rank. Control your feelings, I pray you once more—and speak
          freely.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hastily and
          fervently he pressed his lip upon the beautiful hand of Rubellia,
          and whispered something into her ear. She started, and I think
          blushed in the moonlight; but neither seemed offended very deeply
          with what he had said, nor with the gesture he had
          used.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name=
          "Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Softly, softly,”</span> whispered the Centurion,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“be not ashamed, fair lady, of the love of
          thy servant.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But (whether the
          echo of his Horatian parody had reached her ear or not, I cannot
          tell,) scarcely had these words been uttered, ere Rubellia started
          from her seat, and began to move pretty quickly down the shaded
          alley, as if towards the entrance of the gardens. Xerophrastes sate
          still for a moment, even after the lady had arisen, covering his
          eyes, and part of his broad forehead with his hands, as if buried
          in his own thoughts too deeply to be with ease affected with a
          sense of things passing around him. Then, at last, he arose, and
          uttering an exclamation of surprise, walked after the noble dame,
          taking heed, however, (it did not escape our observation,) to
          arrange, as he rapidly followed her, the massive folds of his
          mantle into a graceful drapery.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sabinus
          restrained himself till they were beyond the reach of his voice;
          but he then made himself ample amends. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ha!”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is this
          to be the end? Most pensive ghost of Leberinus, is this to be thy
          successor?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Good heavens!”</span>
          said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sabinus, do you think it possible
          she should make the pedagogue her husband—she that was but
          yesterday so desperately enamoured of the beautiful young
          Sextus?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“My dear islander,”</span>
          quoth the Centurion, <span class="tei tei-q">“do you remember the
          story of a certain beautiful boy, called
          Adonis?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“To be sure,”</span> said
          I, <span class="tei tei-q">“who is ignorant of the story of Adonis,

          these, and I take it of a few more besides; and yet do you talk as
          if Venus, after the white boar’s tusk had pierced the white thigh
          of her Adonis, had made no use of her beautiful girdle, but to wipe
          the tears from her pretty eyes withal?—her girdle, of which, heaven
          pity your memory, I know not how many blessed ages after Adonis had

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such talk passed
          as we were leaving the gardens of Trajan. But as we advanced into
          the more peopled region, we found the streets full of clamour,
          insomuch that quiet discourse could no longer be carried on. The
          evening was one of the most lovely I had ever seen, and the moon
          was shedding a soft and yellow light upon the lofty towers and
          trees, and upon all that long perspective of pillars and porticos.
          Yet groups of citizens were seen running to and fro with torches in
          their hands; while many more were stationary in impenetrable
          crowds, which had the air, as it seemed to us, of being detained in
          the expectation of some spectacle. Accordingly we had not jostled
          on much farther, ere there arose behind us a peal of what seemed to
          me martial music; but my companion, as soon as the sounds reached
          him, warned me that a procession of the priests of Cybele must be
          at hand.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last they
          came quite close to us, and passed on dancing around the image of
          the Goddess, and singing the chaunt of Atys. A path being opened
          for them by the crowd all along, they made no halt in their
          progress, but went on at the same pace, some of them leaping high
          from the ground as they dashed their cymbals, and others dancing
          lowly while they blew the long Phrygian trumpets and crooked horns
          of brass. The image itself was seated in a brazen chariot, to which
          brazen lions also were fastened, the whole being borne on the
          shoulders of some of the assistants. Behind it came others, beating
          great hollow drums; and then again more, leaping, and dancing, and
          singing, like those who preceded it. They were all clad in long
          Asiatic vests, with lofty tiaras; and their countenances, as well
          as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name=
          "Pg286" id="Pg286" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>their voices,
          intimated sufficiently that they were ministers of the same order
          to which the hapless Atys had belonged. Yet nothing but enthusiasm
          and triumph could be discovered in their manner of singing that
          terrible hymn.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had not
          advanced much beyond the spot where we were standing, ere they
          stopped of a sudden, and, placing the chariot and image of Cybele
          between the pillars of one of the porticos that run out into the
          street, began a more solemn species of saltation. When they had
          finished this dance also, and the more stately and measured song of
          supplication with which it was accompanied, the priests then turned
          to the multitude, and called upon all those who reverenced the
          Didymæan mysteries, to approach and offer their gifts. Immediately
          the multitude that were beyond formed themselves into a close
          phalanx, quite across the street, and torches being conveyed into
          the hands of such as stood in the foremost rank, there was left in
          front of the image an open space, brightly illuminated, for the
          convenience, as it seemed, of those who might come forward to carry
          their offerings to the foot of the statue. And, indeed, it appeared
          as if these were not likely to be few in number; for the way being
          quite blocked up by those torch-bearers, no one could hope to pass
          on easily without giving something, or to pass at all without being
          observed. Not a few chariots, therefore, and litters also, having
          been detained, the persons seated in these vehicles seemed to be
          anxious, as soon as possible, to present their offerings, that the
          path onward might be cleared to them by command of the priests. It
          was necessary, however, as it turned out, that each person
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name=
          "Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in advancing to the
          chariot of Cybele, should imitate the motions practised by the
          Galli themselves; and this circumstance, as may be imagined, was
          far from being the most acceptable part of the ceremony to some of
          those who had thus been arrested. A few of the common sort, both
          men and women, stepped boldly into the open ring, and with great
          appearance of joy went through the needful gesticulations. But, at
          first, none of the more lordly tenants of the chariots and litters
          seemed to be able to prevail on themselves to follow the example.
          At length, however, the impatience even of these dignified persons
          began to overcome their reluctance; one and another red-edged gown
          was seen to float in lofty undulations across the torch-lighted
          stage, and when a handful of coin was heard to ring upon the basin
          of the Goddess, doubt not the priests half-cracked their cheeks in
          blowing horn and trumpet, and clattered upon their great tambarines
          as violently as if they had made prize of another Atys. But how did
          the Centurion chuckle when he observed that one of the next
          chariots was no other than that of Rubellia herself, and perceived
          that she and the Stoic were now about to pass onwards like the
          rest, at the expense of exhibiting their agility before the
          multitude.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Jove in heaven!”</span> cried he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I thought the garden scene was all in all; but this is
          supreme! Behold how the sturdy Thracian tucks up his garment, and
          how, nodding to the blows of the tambarine, he already meditates
          within himself the appropriate convolutions. And the pretty widow!
          by the girdle of Venus, she also is pointing her trim toe, and,
          look ye! better and better, do you not see that she has given her
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name=
          "Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>veil to the Stoic,
          that so she may perform the more expeditely?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment,
          some one from behind laid hold of my arm, and whispered my name. I
          looked round, and perceived an old man, wrapped in a very large and
          deep mantle, the folds of which, however, were so arranged that I
          could see very little of his features. Stepping a pace or two
          backwards, he beckoned to me with his hand. I hesitated; but his
          gesture being repeated, I also entered within the shade of the
          pillars, and then he, dropping his mantle on his shoulders, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Valerius, do you not remember me? We met
          last at the tomb of the Sempronii.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“At the tomb of the Sempronii!”</span> said I; and
          recognized, indeed, the features of the Christian priest, who had
          treated me on that eventful evening with so much courtesy; but my
          wonder was great to find him in such a situation; for I had seen
          him conveyed away between armed guards, and I could not imagine by
          what means he, of all others, should have so soon regained his
          freedom. He observed my astonishment, and said, in a low voice,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“My friend, perhaps I might have as much
          reason to be surprised with seeing you here, as you have in seeing
          me. But follow me into this house, where we may communicate what
          has occurred.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hope of
          perhaps hearing something concerning Athanasia determined me. I
          cast a look towards Sabinus, and saw him attentively engaged in
          witnessing the performance; and hoping that he might continue to
          amuse himself so for a few minutes longer, I permitted the old man
          to lead me into the vestibule. The slaves, who were waiting there,
          seemed to receive him <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page289">[pg
          289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>with much respect. He passed them, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not trouble yourselves—I shall rejoin
          your master;”</span> and shortly ushered me into a chamber situated
          over the hall of entrance, where a grave personage was reclining by
          the open window. He perceived not our approach till we had come
          close up to his couch, for he was occupied with what was going on
          without. When the old man accosted him, and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Pontius, I have been successful. Here is my friend,
          Caius Valerius,”</span> the stranger rose up, and saluted me with
          kindness. <span class="tei tei-q">“Caius Valerius,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“will pardon me for being desirous of
          seeing him here, when he learns that I was one of his father’s
          oldest friends, and served with him many campaigns both in Germany
          and Britain. I should have been ill pleased had I heard that you
          had been in Rome, and departed without my having an opportunity of
          retracing, as I now do, the image of my comrade.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had to answer
          not a few questions concerning the situation of my mother and
          myself, before I could lead the conversation into the channel I
          desired; and at length, indeed, it was not so much any thing I
          said, as the readiness of the priest himself, which gave to it that
          direction; for the first pause that occurred in the discourse
          between Pontius and myself, he filled up, by saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And now, will Valerius pardon me for asking, if he has
          ever looked again into the narrative of Luke, or whether his
          curiosity, in regard to these matters, has been entirely satisfied
          by the adventures of one unfortunate night?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The manner in
          which Pontius regarded me when the priest said this, left me no
          doubt that he was at least favourably inclined to the opinions of
          the Christians; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg
          290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>so
          I answered without hesitation, <span class="tei tei-q">“My
          curiosity, instead of being satisfied by what I saw that evening,
          received new strength; but you may easily believe that the troubles
          in which I was involved, and still more the troubles with which I
          know others yet to be surrounded, have hitherto taken away from me
          both the means and the power of gratifying my curiosity as I would
          wish.—But tell me, I pray you, by what means is your imprisonment
          at an end?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“My friend,”</span>
          replied the priest, <span class="tei tei-q">“you speak naturally
          but rashly. I believe you yourself are the only one of those
          surprised in the tower, whose imprisonment has as yet terminated.
          Yet hope, good hope is not absent,—above all, I trust there is no
          reason to despair concerning that dear child who interfered in your
          behalf, when a bold, and, I fear me, a false man, had drawn his
          weapon to your peril. As for me, I have but gained the liberty of
          an hour or two, and long ere dawn I shall be restored again to my
          fetters.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Your fetters!”</span>
          said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“am I to understand, that, by the
          connivance of a Roman jailor, you are this night at liberty to
          perambulate the streets of Rome?”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Young man,”</span> answered the priest, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he is a Christian.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Even for his sake,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the name is honourable.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Valerius,”</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I
          pray you speak not things which may hereafter give pain to your
          memory. Already you have read something of the life of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>, for whose sake our
          name is indeed honourable—of Him I trust you shall ere long both
          read and think more; but how shall I bless God, that threw my lot,
          since captivity it was to be, into a place where such authority was
          to have the superintendence of me? Yet more, how shall <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>I be sufficiently grateful, that She, in
          all things so delicate, although in nothing fearful, has shared the
          same blessing?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Heavens,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“what
          do I hear!—Is Athanasia indeed lodged in the same prison with
          yourself, and may she also go abroad thus freely?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Think not,”</span> he replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that I embrace such freedom for any purposes of mine
          own. What I do for the service to which I am bound, think not that
          Athanasia will ever desire to do for herself. She abides her time
          patiently where the lot hath been cast for her; in due season, if
          such be the will of the Lord, she shall regain that in truth, of
          which this is but the shadow.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“God grant our prayer,”</span> said Pontius,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and not ours only, but the prayer of all
          that know her, and have heard of this calamity!—Whatever the
          exertions of her family and their friends can accomplish, most
          surely shall not be awanting. Would that those who are linked to
          her by ties yet more sacred had the power, as they have the will,
          to serve her! Yet Hope must never be rejected. The investigations
          of this very night may produce the true accomplices of Cotilius;
          and then Trajan will be satisfied that the Christians stand
          guiltless of that treason.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas!”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“if this
          faith be a crime, how can any one hope to follow it without being
          continually liable to accidents as unfortunate? In Rome, at all
          events, what madness is it thus to tempt the fate which impends
          over the discovery of that which it must be so difficult, so
          impossible to conceal?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aged Priest
          laid his finger on his lips, and pointed to the window. I listened,
          and heard distinctly the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
          292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>shrill voices of the mutilated dancers, as
          they brake forth above the choral murmurs of the drums and cymbals,
          and I perceived that the bloody legend of Atys was once more the
          subject of their song.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ancient
          waited till the voices were drowned again in the clamour of the
          instruments, and then said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">“Young
          man, do you know to what horrid story these words of theirs refer?
          Do you know what sounds all these are designed to imitate? Do you
          know what terror—what flight—what blood—what madness are here set
          forth in honour of a cruel demon—or rather, I should say, for the
          gain of these miserable and maimed hirelings? Do you know all these
          things, and yet give counsel of flight and of cowardice to me, upon
          whose head the hand of Christ’s holy apostle hath been laid? Read,
          dear Valerius, read and ponder well.—My prayers, and the prayers of
          one that is far purer than me—they are ever with you. But now since
          I have introduced you to Pontius, why should I delay here any
          longer? He, both for your father’s sake and for your own, and for
          that of the faith, (of which you have had some glimpses) will
          abundantly aid you in all things. Deal not coldly nor distantly
          with him. I commit you into his hands, as a brand to be snatched
          from the burning.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pontius reached
          forth his hand and grasped mine in token of acquiescence in all the
          old man expressed. He, by and by, looking into the street, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“These jugglers have now departed to their
          dens, and the gaping multitudes have dispersed. But I still see one
          person walking up and down, as if expecting somebody; and it seems
          to me that it is the same, Valerius, who <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>was in your company.”</span> I perceived that
          it was indeed Sabinus, whistling to himself on the bright side of
          the pavement. I therefore bade them adieu, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dear father, when shall I see you again, and when
          shall I hear farther of Athanasia?”</span>—The old man pausing for
          a moment, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“To-morrow at noontide be
          in the Forum, over against the statue of Numa. You will there find
          tidings.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion
          plainly intimated that he took it for granted I had been engaged in
          something which I wished to keep from his knowledge; but such
          affairs made no great impression on him; and after laughing out his
          laugh, he bade me farewell by the portico of Licinius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the morning I
          found my kinsman and his son extremely uneasy, in consequence of
          the absence of Xerophrastes, who had not returned during the night;
          but Sabinus came in while they were talking to me, and narrated,
          without hesitation, all he had seen and heard both in the garden of
          Trajan, and at the procession of the Galli. Young Sextus could
          scarcely be restrained by respect for his father, from expressing,
          rather too openly, his satisfaction in the course which the affairs
          of the disappointed lady appeared to be taking; while the orator
          muttered words which I thought boded not much of good to the
          ambitious pedagogue. The Centurion alone regarded all these things
          as matters of mere amusement, or so at least he seemed to regard
          them; for, as I have already hinted, I was not without my
          suspicion, that he was at bottom by no means well pleased with the
          contemplation of the future splendour of the Stoic.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, after
          many jests had been exchanged between Sextus and the Centurion
          concerning this incongruous amour, Licinius said, he was in so far
          much relieved by what he had heard, as it satisfied him that both
          the widow and Xerophrastes were now otherwise <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>occupied, than in prosecuting their
          designs against the niece of his friend Capito.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I myself,”</span> he continued, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“was all yesterday, as well as the day before, exerting
          every means in my power for her extrication from this unfortunate
          confinement. Cotilius, without question, has indeed been a traitor;
          but I believe the Prince himself is, by this time, well inclined to
          absolve, not only the young lady, but by far the greater part of
          those who were taken with her, from any participation in his
          traitorous designs. The charge, however, of which it rests with
          them alone to exculpate themselves, is one of a nature so serious,
          that it is impossible to contemplate without much anxiety the pain
          to which so many families—above all, the noble and excellent
          Sempronii—may still be exposed. But this day Cotilius will, in all
          likelihood, pay the last penalty of <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></span>
          crimes—and then we shall see what intercession may avail. Would to
          heaven there were any one who could obtain access to the deluded
          lady, and prevail with her to do that which would be more effectual
          than I can hope any intercession to prove. This infatuation—this
          dream—this madness—is, indeed, a just source of fear; and yet, why
          should we suppose it to be already so deeply confirmed in a breast
          young, ingenuous, so full, according to report, of every thing
          modest and submissive? Surely this affectionate girl cannot be
          insensible to the affliction of those who love her.—But you still
          shake your head, Valerius; well, it is in our hands to do what we
          can; as for the issue, who can hope to divert Trajan from doing
          that which he believes to be just? Our best hope is in his
          justice——”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And in his clemency,”</span> interrupted the
          Centurion; <span class="tei tei-q">“you will scarcely persuade me
          that Cæsar can meditate any thing serious concerning a young
          beauty, who has been guilty of nothing but a little superstition
          and enthusiasm. Nobody will confound her case with that of any
          obstinate old fanatic. In the meantime, what avails it to distress
          ourselves more than is necessary? Licinius is able to do something;
          and as for Valerius, the best thing he can do is to get on
          horseback, and go with Sextus and myself to inspect the cohorts
          that have arrived from Calabria.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Young Sextus, on
          all occasions fond of military spectacles, embraced this proposal;
          and fain would they both have prevailed on me to accede to it
          likewise. I knew, however, that it would be impossible, if I
          accompanied them, to keep my appointment with the old Christian;
          and that I was resolved on no account to forego. I therefore
          retired to my chamber, there to await the approach of the hour; and
          spent the time till it drew near, in perusing once more the volume
          which had been restored to me by Athanasia. This volume, and the
          letter which I have before mentioned, I placed together in my
          bosom, before I went forth into the city.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I entered the
          Forum, and found it, as formerly thronged with multitudes of busy
          litigants and idle spectators. A greater concourse, indeed, than
          was usual, crowded not it only, but the avenues to it, and the
          neighbouring streets, by reason of a solemn embassy from the
          Parthian, which was to have audience that day in the Senate. But I,
          for my part, having discovered the statue of Numa Pompilius,
          resolved to abide <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg

          it, lest, being mingled in the tumult of the expecting multitudes,
          I should, by any mischance, escape the notice of the old man, who,
          I doubted not, meant to seek me there in person. The time, however,
          went on—senator after senator entered the temple—and, at last, the
          shouts of the people announced that Trajan had arrived. And
          immediately after he had gone in, the pomp of the embassy appeared,
          and every eye was fixed upon the long line of slaves, laden with
          cloth of gold and rich merchandise, and upon the beautiful troop of
          snow-white horses, which pawed the ground, in magnificent
          caparisons, before the gate of the Senate-house. But while all were
          intent upon the spectacle, I observed a little fair-haired girl
          standing over against me, who, after looking at me for some
          moments, said with great modesty, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir, if
          you be Caius Valerius, I pray you, follow me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I followed her
          in silence up the hanging stairs, and, in a word, had soon reached
          the level of the Capitol, from whence, looking back, I could
          perceive the whole array of the forensic multitudes far below me.
          The child paused for a moment at the summit, and then, still saying
          nothing, conducted me across two magnificent squares, and round
          about the Temple of Jupiter, until, at length, she stopped at one
          of the side doors of an edifice, which, from the manner in which it
          was guarded, I already suspected to be the Mammertine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl
          knocked, and he who kept the gate, saluting her cheerfully, allowed
          us to pass without question into the interior of the prison. My
          companion tripped before me along many passages, till we reached at
          length a chamber which was arranged in such a manner that I
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name=
          "Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>could with difficulty
          believe it to belong to a place of punishment.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here I was soon
          joined by the old priest, (whose name, if I have not before
          mentioned it, was Aurelius Felix,) together with a mild-looking man
          of middle age, whom he desired me to salute as the keeper of the
          prison, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here, Valerius, is that
          Silo, of whom yesterday evening you spake with so great admiration.
          But I hope the benevolence of a Christian will ere long cease to be
          an object of so much wonder in your eyes.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My father,”</span> said the jailer, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“methinks you yourself say too much about such little
          things. But, in the meantime, let us ask Valerius if he has heard
          any thing of what has been determined by Cæsar.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I answered by
          telling what I had just heard from Licinius; upon which the
          countenance of the old man was not a little lightened; but Silo
          fixed his eyes upon the ground, and seemed to regard the matter
          very seriously. He said, however, after a pause, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“So far, at least, it is well. Let us hope that the
          calumnies which have been detected, may turn more and more of
          discredit upon those that have gone abroad concerning that which is
          dearer to you, my father, and to all your true companions, than any
          thing of what men call their own. But, alas! these, after all, are
          but poor tidings for our dear young lady.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Fear not,”</span> answered Aurelius: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“have I not told you already oftentimes, that strength
          of heart goes not with bone and sinew, and that my gentle child is
          prepared for all things? She also well knows that the servant is
          not greater than the master.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man
          motioned to us to remain where we were, and withdrew. I sate for
          some minutes by the side of Silo, who was, indeed, manifestly much
          troubled, until at length the same modest little damsel opened the
          door, and addressing the jailer as her father, asked leave to
          conduct me to Aurelius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The child led
          me, therefore, into the adjoining chamber, and tapped gently at a
          door on the other side of it. The voice of the old priest bade us
          come in, and Athanasia arose with him to receive me. She was
          dressed in a white tunic, her hair braided in dark folds upon her
          forehead; her countenance was calm, and, but for the paleness of
          her lips, I should have said that her gravity scarcely partook of
          sadness. When, however, we had exchanged our salutations, it was
          evident that some effort had been necessary for this appearance of
          serenity; for when she spoke to me her voice trembled in every
          tone, and, as she stooped to caress my young guide, who had sate
          down by her feet, I saw the tear that had been gathering drop
          heavily, and lose itself among the bright clusters of the little
          damsel’s hair. I took her unresisting hand, and imitated as best I
          could the language of consolation. But it seemed as if my poor
          whispers only served to increase the misery. She covered her face
          with her hands, and sobs and tears were mingled together, and the
          blood glowed red in her neck, in the agony of her lamentation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old priest
          was moved at first scarcely less than myself by this sorrowful
          sight. Yet the calmness of age deserted him not long, and after a
          moment there remained nothing on his countenance but the gravity
          and tenderness of compassion. He arose from his seat, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name="Pg300" id="Pg300"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and walked quietly towards the end of
          the apartment, from which when he returned, after a brief space,
          there was an ancient volume open in his hand. And standing near us,
          he began to read aloud, in the Greek tongue, words which were then
          new, and which have ever since been in a peculiar manner dear to
          me.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">God is our refuge and
          strength; a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we
          fear though the earth be removed; though the mountains be carried
          into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be
          troubled; though the mountains shake with the swelling
          thereof.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Athanasia took
          her hands from her face, and gradually composing herself, looked
          through her tears upon the old man as he proceeded.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">There is a river, the

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Lord of Hosts is
          with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The blood had
          mounted in the countenance of Aurelius, ere he reached these last
          words. The tears also had been dried up on the pale cheek of
          Athanasia; and although her voice was not heard, I saw that her
          lips moved fervently along with those of the priest. Even in me,
          ignorant of their source, the words of the royal prophet produced I
          know not what of buoyance and emotion, and perhaps my lips, too,
          had involuntarily essayed to follow them; for when he <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>paused from his reading, the old man
          turned to me with a face full of benignity, and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes, Valerius, it is even so; Homer, Pindar,
          Æschylus—these, indeed, can stir the blood; but it is such poetry
          as this that alone can sooth in sorrow, and strengthen in the hour
          of tribulation. Your vain-glorious Greeks called all men barbarians
          but themselves; and yet these words, and thousands not less
          precious than these, consoled the afflictions, and ennobled the
          triumphs of the chosen race of Israel long, long years, ere ever
          the boasted melody of Ionian or Doric verse had been heard of. From
          this alone, young man, you may judge what measure of candour
          inhabits along with the disdain of our proud enemies:—how fairly,
          without question, or opportunity of defence, the charge of
          barbarity is heaped upon what they are pleased to call our
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">superstition</span></span>;—how wisely the
          learned and the powerful of the earth have combined in this league
          against the truth which they know not,—of which they fear or
          despise the knowledge. Surely the truth is mighty, and the gates of
          hell shall not prevail against her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But, alas! my dear father,”</span> said Athanasia,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I fear me this is not the place, nor the
          situation, in which Valerius might be most likely to listen to your
          words. It may be that his own narrow escape, to say nothing of our
          present danger, has rendered him even more cautious than he was
          before.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And who, my dear child,”</span> he replied
          hastily,—<span class="tei tei-q">“and who is he that shall dare to
          blame caution, or to preach, above all in such things as these, the
          rashness that is of folly? Valerius will not believe that we, like
          the miserable creatures whose impious songs he heard <span class=

          upon the fears of the ignorant, and harassing, with dark and lying

          are no wild stories of blood-thirsty deities, and self-sacrificing

          vainly sought by all the ingenuity of reason. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Here</span></span> is
          that of which some faint and mysterious anticipations would appear
          to have been shadowed forth in the visions of Plato. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Here</span></span> is
          that which, as that Mighty Martyr who died in this very city hath
          said, innumerable prophets and kings of the old time desired to
          see, and yet saw not. Do nothing rashly, young man; but it is
          possible, as you yourself well know, that this may be the last
          opportunity I shall ever have of speaking with you; and therefore,
          before we part, I must needs charge you solemnly, that henceforth,
          if your knowledge increase not, the sin shall be upon your head. I
          charge you, Valerius, that when you return to your island, you blot
          not from your memory the things that you have seen and heard in
          this great city of light and of darkness. Examine—judge—ask aid,
          and aid shall not be refused you. I take Athanasia to witness, that
          I have given you the warning that is needful.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, sir!”</span> said Athanasia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I am sure it shall not be in vain that you have done
          so. I am sure Valerius will never forget this hour——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She gazed in my
          face, and a tear was again visible, yet on all her countenance
          there was no other semblance of passion. The venerable Aurelius
          clasping his thin hands together, whispered,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Would to God that I were here alone! Shall the axe be
          laid to the root of the fair young tree that hath but begun to
          blossom, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg
          303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>when so many old trunks stand around withered
          with the lightnings, and sore broken by the winds?—The will of the
          Lord be done!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Amen!”</span> said Athanasia, taking the old man by
          the hand, and smiling, I think, more cheerfully than I had yet seen
          her—<span class="tei tei-q">“My dear father, I fear you yourself,
          after all, are teaching Valerius to take but a sad farewell of
          us.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas! my child,”</span> he replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“he must have a hard heart that could look unmoved on
          that sweet face in this hour of sadness. But we are in the hands of
          a greater than Trajan. If so it please Him, all may yet go well
          with us even here upon the earth. You may live to see many happy
          years among your kindred—and I, (the old man smiled most serenely,)
          and for me, my gray hairs may be laid in bloodless dust. Whatever
          awaits us, blessed be the name of the Lord!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So saying, the
          old man retired from the chamber, and once more I was left alone in
          the presence of Athanasia. I took from my bosom the book and the
          letter which I had placed there, and laid them upon her knee. She
          broke the seal, and read hastily what Tisias had written, and then
          concealed the scroll within her tunic, saying, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Alas! Valerius, little did the brave old soldier
          suspect how soon his peril was to be mine—Will you permit me like
          him to make you my messenger?—will you seek out my cousin, my
          sister, and tell Sempronia in what condition you have found me?—no,
          not in what you found—but in what you now see me. Will you go,
          Valerius, and speak comfort to my poor friend? Her pity, at least,
          I am sure is mingled with no angry thoughts; and yet she only has
          reason to complain, for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
          304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>her secret thoughts were not hid from me, and,
          alas! I concealed mine from her.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have already seen her,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“and you do her no more than justice. But, indeed,
          Sempronius himself thinks of you even as gently as his
          daughter.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I doubt it not, Valerius; but, alas! there are many
          others besides these; and I know not what relic of weakness it is,
          but methinks I could have borne the worst more easily, had it not
          been for what I picture to myself of their resentment. Alas! I am
          cut off for ever from the memory of my kindred.”</span> She threw
          open the lattice, as if that she might inhale the free air, and her
          eyes wandered to and fro over all the magnificent prospect that lay
          stretched out below us,—the temples and high porticos of the
          Forum—the gleaming battlements and long arcades of the Palatine—the
          baths, and theatres, and circuses between and the river—Tiber
          winding away among fields and groves—and the sky of Italy extending
          over all things its arch of splendour. When the trumpets were blown
          by the gate of the Senate-house, the sound floated upwards to us as
          gently as if it had been borne over the waters. The shouts of the
          multitude were faintly re-echoed from the towers and the rocks. The
          princely pageant shewed like a pomp of pigmies; spear, and helmet,
          and eagle glittered together, almost like dews upon the distant
          herbage. Athanasia rested her eye once more upon the wide range of
          the champaign, where fields and forests were spread out in
          interminable succession—away towards the northern region and the
          visible mountains. She raised her hand, and said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Valerius, your home lies far away yonder. I must
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name=
          "Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>give you something
          which you shall promise me to carry with you, and preserve in
          memory—of Rome.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before I had
          time to make any answer, she had taken out of a casket that stood
          beside us, a scroll of parchment, bound with a silk ribbon, which
          she immediately put into my hands, and—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To-morrow,”</span> said she, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Valerius, our fate, they tell us, must at length be
          determined;—if we share the fate of Tisias, the last gift of Tisias
          shall be yours. If, however, any mercy be extended to us, I cannot
          part with that memorial of a dying martyr. I must keep to myself
          the old man’s favourite volume, for it was for me he had designed
          it. But I have made a copy of the same book for yourself. I have
          written it since I came hither, Valerius, and you must not despise
          it because the Mammertine has not furnished the finest of
          materials. Take this, Valerius, and take with it my thanks—my
          prayers. I know you will not forget my message to my dear
          sister.—Sextus and she—may many happy days be theirs—and
          yours.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I kissed the sad
          gift, and placed it in my bosom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Valerius,”</span> she said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“dry up your tears. You weep for me because I am a
          Christian; forget not that the Roman blood flows in my veins, and
          think not that its current is chilled, because I have forsworn the
          worship of idol and demon, and am in peril for the service of The
          Living God.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          weep for you, but not for you alone. I ask nothing—I hope
          nothing—but I could not bear to part with you thus, and not to tell
          you that when I part from you, I bid farewell to all things. Pardon
          me—once more pardon me.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A single flush
          of crimson passed over her face, and I saw her lips move, but the
          syllables died ere they were uttered. She continued for a moment
          gazing on me, pale, and trembling; and then at last she fell upon
          my neck and wept—not audibly—but I felt her tears.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Athanasia was
          still folded to my bosom in that strange agony of sorrow and of
          confidence, when Silo, the jailer, entered the apartment, abrupt
          and breathless.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, sir!”</span> said he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“your sufferings are mine—but it is necessary that you
          should leave us, and on the instant, for the Prefect is already at
          the gate, and unquestionably he will examine every part of the
          prison; and should you be recognized as the person who was taken in
          the Mausoleum, you see plainly to what suspicions it might give
          rise. Come then, sir, and let me secure your escape—we shall take
          care to warn you of whatever occurs, and we shall send for you, if
          there be opportunity.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Athanasia
          recovered herself almost instantly, when she heard what Silo
          said.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We shall meet again,”</span> said I.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And I tore
          myself away from her; and the jailer having once again committed me
          to the guidance of his child, I was in a few moments conducted to
          the same postern by which I had been introduced. In a word, I found
          myself in the court of the Capitol, at the instant when the
          Prefect, with all his attendants, was entering by the main gate of
          the Mammertine.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On reaching
          home, I was told that Licinius was still absent; and found at the
          same time a billet upon the table, which informed me that Sabinus
          had carried Sextus with him to his quarters, and that both expected
          I would join them there immediately upon my return. I knew not how
          to refuse compliance, and yet I could not bear the thought of being
          so far from the <a name="corr307" id="corr307" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Capitol</span>, in
          case of any message being sent to me from the prison. Since I could
          do no better, however, I charged Boto to remain in my apartment
          till sunset, and bring me, without delay, any letter or messenger
          that might arrive in my absence. Should none such appear within
          that space, I gave him a note, which I desired him to deliver into
          the hands of Silo; and having, as I thought, furnished him with
          sufficient directions how to discharge this commission, I myself
          took the path to the Prætorian Camp, where I thought it very
          probable that I might gather some new intelligence as to
          Cotilius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Prætorian
          who had accompanied Sabinus at my release from the rustic tower,
          recognized me at the gate, and conducted me immediately to the
          Centurion, who, to my surprise and displeasure, had directed that I
          should be ushered without delay to, not his own apart<span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ment, but the general table. Here I was
          received most courteously, however, and hoping the feast was nearly
          over, took my place near my friend.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Several of those
          high-fed warriors who had more than once disposed of the empire,
          were reclining upon rich couches around the board; and their
          effeminate exterior would, perhaps, have made them less formidable
          in my eyes, had I not remembered the youth of the great Cæsar, the
          Parthian retreat of Antony, and the recent death of Otho.<a id=
          "noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> There
          were present, besides, a few casual visiters like ourselves; among
          others, a sleek Flamen, who reclined on the right hand of the
          presiding Tribune, and a little bald Greek, who seemed to think it
          incumbent upon himself to fill up every pause in the conversation,
          by malicious anecdotes or sarcasms, of which last it was easy to
          see that the Flamen opposite was a favourite subject. Neither wit
          nor impiety, however, could make speedy impression upon the
          smooth-faced Flamen, who seemed to think, if one might judge from
          his behaviour, that the most acceptable service he could render to
          the deities, was to do full and devout justice to the gifts of
          their benevolence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very animated
          discussion concerning the review of the newly-arrived cohorts,
          (which, I have told you, had taken place that morning by the river
          side,) relieved for some time the patient Flamen from the attacks
          of this irreverent person, and engaged the zealous participation of
          those who had hitherto been the most silent of the company.
          Sabinus, among the rest, was ready <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>with a world of remarks upon the equipments,
          the manœuvres, the merits, and the demerits of the troops in
          question; but something he said was quite at variance with the
          sentiments of one of his brother Centurions, who disputed with him
          rather warmly than successfully for a few moments, and at last
          ended with saying,—<span class="tei tei-q">“But why should I take
          so much trouble to discuss the point with you, who, we all know,
          were thinking of other matters, and saw not much more of the review
          than if you had been a hundred miles off from it?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Centurion
          coloured a little, and laughed, as it seemed to me, with rather
          less heartiness than usual; but the disputant pursuing his
          advantage, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, you may laugh if you
          will; but do you think we are all blind, or do you suppose we are
          not acquainted with certain particulars? Well, some people dislike
          the Suburra, but for my part I agree with Sabinus; I think it is
          one of the genteelest places in Rome, and that there are some of
          the snuggest houses in it too—and if old men will die, for me, I
          protest, I don’t see why young men should not succeed them.”</span>
          The Centurion laughed again, and natural ruddiness of complexion
          was, I thought, scarcely quite sufficient to account for the flush
          on his countenance, as he listened to these innuendos. But the
          master of the feast cut the matter short, by saying that he had a
          health to propose, and that he expected all present should receive
          it with honour.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Here,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“is to the fair lady Rubellia, who is never
          absent when the Prætorians turn out, and may all things fair and
          fortunate attend her now and hereafter.”</span> I whispered to
          Sabinus,—<span class="tei tei-q">“My friend, I think you have
          really some reason for blushing. If <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>you had no pity on Xerophrastes, you might at
          least have had some for the pretty widow.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He made no
          answer to this, and looked, if possible, more confused than ever;
          but, just at that moment, a soldier came in, and delivered a billet
          to the presiding Tribune, who handed it to Sabinus immediately
          after he had read it, and said, loud enough to be heard by all
          those who sate near him, <span class="tei tei-q">“I wish the Prince
          would give some of this work to these new comers. But, indeed, I
          wonder what Lictors are good for now-a-days; but every thing that
          these Christians are any way concerned in seems to be a matter of
          importance.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sabinus, having
          read the billet, handed it back again to the Tribune, and said
          aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Exit</span></span> Cotilius!—Who would not be
          of the chorus at the falling of that curtain?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Tribune
          shrugged his shoulders, whispered something into the ear of the
          messenger, and then, dashing more wine into his cup, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Rome will never be a quiet place, nor the
          Prætorian helmet a comfortable head-piece, till these barbarians be
          extirpated.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Flamen
          tossed off a full goblet, and, smiting with his hand upon the
          table, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“There spake a true Roman, and
          a worshipper of the Gods. I rejoice to find that there is still
          some religion in the world; for, what with skulking Jews on the one
          hand, and bold blasphemous Cyrenæans on the other, so help me
          Jupiter, the general prospect is dark enough!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In my opinion,”</span> quoth the bald Greek, putting
          on an air of some gravity, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Jews will
          have the better of the Cyrenæans. Indeed, I should not be much
          surprised to see this Christian superstition supplant every
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name=
          "Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>other.”</span> The
          Flamen half started from his couch. <span class="tei tei-q">“You
          observe, gentlemen,”</span> proceeded the Greek,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what great advantage any new superstition has over any
          thing of the same sort that is old. We all know, for example, that
          Isis and Cybele have for many years past left comparatively few
          worshippers to Mars, Apollo,—even to Jupiter. It is lamentable; but
          it is true. I have heard that unless on some very great day, a gift
          is now quite a rarity upon the altar of any of the true ancient
          deities of Rome. Egypt and Mount Ida have done this; and why should
          not Palestine succeed as well as either? In the meantime, the
          enlightened contemplate every different manifestation of the
          superstitious principle with equal indifference; and, I confess to
          you, I have been a little surprised to perceive how far Trajan is
          from imitating their example. But that Chæronæan master of his,
          that Plutarch, was always an old woman; and I fear the Prince has
          not been able to shake off the impression of his ridiculous
          stories.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hush!”</span> quoth the master of the day,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“if it please you, nothing can be said here
          against either Trajan or his friends; and, as for Plutarch, he was
          one of the pleasantest fellows that I ever met with.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sabinus,
          desirous of restoring the harmony of the assembly, called forthwith
          on a musical senior, to join him in a song. The gentleman required
          solicitation, but at last announced his consent to attempt the
          female part in the duet of Horace and Lydia. Sabinus, always ready,
          began to roar out the tender words of regret and expostulation
          which the most elegant of poets has ascribed to himself; and the
          delicate squeaking response of our wrinkled Lydia formed an
          agreeable contrast.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg
          312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All, in short,
          were once more in perfect good humour, when another soldier
          appeared behind the couch of the president, and handed to him what
          seemed to be another billet of the same complexion. He tossed the
          paper as before to my friend, who looked very serious as he read
          it.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Caius,”</span> he whispered,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“an additional guard is ordered to the
          Palatine—and the reason is said to be that the rest of the
          Christian prisoners are to be examined, within an hour, by the
          Emperor himself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had scarcely
          had a moment to compose myself, when one of the slaves in
          attendance signified that a person wished to speak with me in the
          anti-chamber. It was Dromo.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span>
          said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I have no time for explanation.
          Silo wishes to see you—I left Boto with him at the
          Mammertine.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we walked
          from the camp, Sabinus, with his guard, passed without noticing me;
          and I received some explanations which I must give to you very
          briefly. Boto, mistrusting his recollection of my instructions, had
          requested Dromo to assist him in finding his way to the Mammertine;
          and the Cretan had come to be witness of a scene, which, in spite
          of his sarcastic disposition, he could not narrate without tokens
          of sympathy. I mentioned to you that my faithful slave, in coming
          with me to Rome, had indulged the hope of meeting once more with a
          brother, who many years before had been carried off from Britain. I
          smiled when the poor man expressed confidence that he should find
          out this ere he had been many days in the metropolis of the world.
          But now, in truth, a fortunate accident had recompensed much
          ill-regulated search. He had found his brother, and he had found
          him in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg
          313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>Mammertine. That very brother was Silo, to
          whose kindness I, and one dearer than myself, had been so deeply
          indebted. The Cretan, himself a slave and an exile, had partaken in
          the feelings of the long-lost brothers, and hastened to bring me
          from the camp, that Boto might be spared the pain of immediately
          parting from Silo.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had hurried
          along the darkening streets, and up the ascent of the Capitoline,
          scarce listening to the story of the Cretan. On reaching the
          summit, we found the courts about the Temple of Jupiter already
          occupied by detachments of foot. I hastened to the Mammertine—and
          before the postern opened to admit us, the Prætorian squadron had
          drawn up at the great gate. Sabinus beckoned me to him.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Caius,”</span> said he, stooping on his
          horse, <span class="tei tei-q">“would to heaven I had been spared
          this duty! Cotilius comes forth this moment, and then we go back to
          the Palatine; and I fear—I fear we are to guard thither your
          Athanasia. If you wish to enter the prison, quicken your
          steps.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We had scarcely
          entered the inner-court, ere Sabinus also, and about a score of his
          Prætorians, rode into it. Silo and Boto were standing together; and
          both had already hastened towards me; but the jailer, seeing the
          Centurion, was constrained to part from me with one hurried
          word:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Pity me, for I also am most
          wretched. But you know the way—here, take this key—hasten to my
          dear lady, and tell her what commands have come.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alas! I said I
          to myself, of what tidings am I doomed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          and how could I shrink from any pain that might perhaps alleviate
          hers? I took the key, glided along the corridors, and stood once
          more at the door of the chamber in which I had parted from
          Athanasia. No voice answered to my knock; I repeated it three
          times, and then, agitated with indistinct apprehension, hesitated
          no longer to open it. No lamp was burning within the chamber, but
          from without there entered a wavering glare of deep
          saffron-coloured light, which shewed me Athanasia extended on her
          couch. Its ominous and troubled hue had no power to mar the image
          of her sleeping tranquillity. I hung over her for a moment, and was
          about to disturb that slumber—perhaps the last slumber of peace and
          innocence—when the chamber-walls were visited with a yet deeper
          glare. <span class="tei tei-q">“Caius,”</span> she whispered, as I
          stepped from beside the couch; <span class="tei tei-q">“why do you
          leave me? stay, Valerius.”</span> I looked back, but her eye-lids
          were still closed; the same calm smile was upon her dreaming lips.
          The light streamed redder and more red. All in an instant became as
          quiet without as within. I approached the window, and saw Cotilius
          standing in the midst of the court; Sabinus and Silo near him; the
          horsemen drawn up on either side, and a soldier close behind
          resting upon an unsheathed sword. I saw the keen blue eye as fierce
          as ever. I saw that the blood was still fervid in his cheeks: for
          the complexion of this man was of the same bold and florid
          brightness so uncommon in Italy, which you have seen represented in
          the pictures of Sylla, and even the blaze of the torches seemed to
          strive in vain to heighten its natural scarlet. The soldier had
          lifted his sword, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg
          316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>my
          eye was fixed, as by fascination, when suddenly a deep voice was
          heard amidst the deadly silence—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Cotilius!—look up, Cotilius!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aurelius, the
          Christian priest, standing at an open window, not far distant from
          that at which I was placed, stretched forth his fettered hand as he
          spake:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Cotilius! I charge thee, look upon
          the hand from which the blessed water of baptism was cast upon thy
          head. I charge thee, look upon me, and say, ere yet the blow be
          given, upon what hope thy thoughts are fixed?—Is this sword bared
          against the rebel of Cæsar, or a martyr of Jesus?—I charge thee,
          speak; and for thy soul’s sake speak truly.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A bitter motion
          of derision passed over his lips, and he nodded, as if impatiently,
          to the Prætorian. Instinctively I turned me from the spectacle, and
          my eye rested again upon the couch of Athanasia—but not upon the
          vision of her tranquillity. The clap with which the corpse fell
          upon the stones had, perhaps, reached the sleeping ear, and we know
          with what swiftness thoughts chase thoughts in the wilderness of
          dreams. So it was that she started at the very moment when the blow
          was given; and she whispered—for it was still but a deep
          whisper—<span class="tei tei-q">“Spare me, Trajan, Cæsar,
          Prince—have pity on my youth—strengthen, strengthen me good
          Lord!—Fie! fie! we must not lie to save life. Felix—Valerius—come
          close to me, Caius—Fie! let us remember we are Romans—’Tis the
          trumpet——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Prætorian
          trumpet sounded the march in the court below, and Athanasia,
          starting from her sleep, gazed wildly around the reddened chamber.
          The blast of the trumpet was indeed in her ear—and Valerius
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name=
          "Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hung over her—but
          after a moment the cloud of the broken dream passed away, and the
          maiden smiled as she extended her hand to me from the couch, and
          began to gather up the ringlets that floated all down upon her
          shoulder. She blushed and smiled mournfully, and asked me hastily
          whence I came, and for what purpose I had come; but before I could
          answer, the glare that was yet in the chamber seemed anew to be
          perplexing her: and she gazed from me to the red walls, and from
          them to me again: and then once more the trumpet was blown, and
          Athanasia sprung from her couch. I know not in what terms I was
          essaying to tell her what was the truth, but I know that ere I had
          said many words, she discovered my meaning. For a moment she looked
          deadly pale, in spite of all the glare of the torch-beams; but she
          recovered herself, and said in a voice that sounded almost as if it
          came from a light heart,—<span class="tei tei-q">“But Caius, I must
          not go to Cæsar, without having at least a garland on my head. Stay
          here, Valerius, and I shall be ready anon—quite ready.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seemed to me
          as if she were less hasty than she had promised, yet many minutes
          elapsed not ere she returned. She plucked a blossom from her hair
          as she drew near to me, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Take it:
          you must not refuse one token more; this also is a sacred gift.
          Caius, you must learn never to look upon it without kissing these
          red streaks—these blessed streaks of the Christian
          flower.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I took the
          flower from her hand, and pressed it to my lips; and I remembered
          that the very first day I saw Athanasia, she had plucked such an
          one, when apart from all the rest, in the gardens of Capito. I told
          her <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name=
          "Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>what I remembered;
          and it seemed as if the little circumstance had called up all the
          image of peaceful days; for once more sorrowfulness gathered upon
          her countenance. If the tear was ready, however, it was not
          permitted to drop; and Athanasia returned again to her flower.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Do you think there are any of them in Britain?”</span>
          said she; <span class="tei tei-q">“or do you think that they would
          grow there? You must go to my dear uncle, and he will not deny you,
          when you tell him that it is for my sake he is to give you some of
          his. They call it the Passion-flower—’tis an emblem of an awful
          thing. Caius, these purple streaks are like trickling drops; and
          here, look ye, they are all round the flower. Is it not very like a
          bloody crown upon a pale brow? I will take one of them in my hand,
          too, Caius; and methinks I shall not disgrace myself when I look
          upon it, even though Trajan should be frowning upon me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had not the
          heart to interrupt her; but heard silently all she said, and I
          thought she said the words quickly and eagerly, as if she feared to
          be interrupted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old priest
          came into the chamber while she was yet speaking so, and said very
          composedly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, my dear child, our
          friend has sent again for us, and the soldiers have been waiting
          already some space, who are to convey us to the Palatine. Come,
          children, we must part for a moment—perhaps it may be but for a
          moment—and Valerius may remain here till we return to him. Here, at
          least, dear Caius, you shall have the earliest tidings, and the
          surest.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The good man
          took Athanasia by the hand, and she, smiling now at length more
          serenely than ever, said <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page319">[pg
          319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>only, <span class="tei tei-q">“Farewell, then,
          Caius, for a little moment!”</span> And so, drawing her veil over
          her face, she passed away from before me, giving, I think, more
          support to the ancient Aurelius than, in her turn, she received
          from him. I began to follow them, but the priest waved his hand as
          if to forbid me:—the door closed after them, and I was alone.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I know not, my
          friends, how to proceed with the narrative of what followed.
          Thoughts, passions, fears, hopes, succeeding so rapidly, give to
          that strange night, when I look back upon it through the vista of
          years, the likeness of some incoherent, agonizing dream. Much,
          without doubt, of what passed within my own mind I have forgotten;
          but it seems to me as if what I saw or heard were still present in
          the distinctness of reality. That chamber in the Mammertine! Its
          walls are before me blazing with the reflection of torch-light, and
          then again, all dim and shadowy—the stars shining feebly upon them
          from the twilight sky—every thing around lonely and silent, except
          the voice of Silo’s little maiden,—bewailing no doubt in her
          privacy the departure of Athanasia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Her father after
          a little time rejoined me. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span>
          said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“all is now quiet here; will you
          walk with me towards the Palatine, that we may at least be near to
          know what is reported of their proceedings? My brother will stay
          here till we return.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We soon had
          descended from the Capitoline, passed through the silent Forum, and
          gained the brow of the opposite eminence, where, as shortly before
          at the Mam<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg
          321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>mertine, all was light and tumult. Every court
          was guarded with soldiery, and groups of busy men were passing
          continually about the imperial gates and porticos. Silo led me
          round and round the buildings, till we reached what seemed an
          abandoned wing. <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“you do not know more familiarly the house
          in which you were born and reared, than I do every corner within
          these wide walls. But I have not crossed the threshold since the
          day Cæsar died.—I was the slave of Domitian, and he gave me my
          freedom.—He was kind to his household.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We entered
          beneath a small portico—and Silo drew a key from his bosom. The
          lock, after two or three trials, yielded to its pressure. A large
          empty hall received us, the circumference of which was scarcely
          visible by the light of the newly-risen moon, streaming down from a
          cupola.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another and
          another sombre chamber we in like manner traversed, till at length
          Silo opened one so comparatively light, that I started back,
          apprehending we had intruded farther than he intended. A second
          glance, however, seemed to indicate that we were still in the
          region of desolation, for a statue lay in the midst of the floor,
          one of its limbs snapped over, as if it had fallen and been
          permitted to remain.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Where are we, Silo?”</span> I whispered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what means this unnatural light among so many symptoms
          of confusion?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said the freedman, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“this is the place in which alone Domitian used to eat
          and sleep, and walk about for the last months of his life, when he
          was jealous of all men; and he contrived these walls, covered all
          over <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name=
          "Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with the shining
          Ethiopian stone, that no one might be able to approach him without
          being discovered. Even when a slave entered, he would start as if
          every side of the chamber had been invaded by some host of men;
          fifty different reflections of one trembling eunuch. It was, they
          say, behind this shattered piece of marble that he ran when he had
          felt the first treacherous blow. Yonder in the corner is the couch
          he slept upon, and he had always a dagger under his head, and he
          called to the little page that was waiting upon him to fetch it
          from the place; but the scabbard only remained; and then in came
          Parthenius and Claudianus, and the gladiator, and the rest, who
          soon finished what the cunning Stephanus had begun. Let us go
          on;—we have not yet reached the place to which I wished to bring
          you—but it is not far off now.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this Silo
          walked to the end of the melancholy chamber, and pressing upon a
          secret spring, where no door was apparent, opened the way into a
          room, darker and smaller than any of those through which we had
          come. He then said to me, <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, sir, you
          must not venture upon one whisper more—you touch on the very heart
          of Domitian’s privacy. It is possible that the place I have been
          leading you to may have been shut up—it may exist no longer; but
          the state in which all things are found here makes me think it more
          likely that Trajan has never been master of its secret. And in that
          case, we shall be able both to see and to hear, without being
          either seen or heard, exactly as Domitian used to do, when there
          was any council held either in the Mars or the Apollo.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I started at the
          boldness of the project which now, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>for the first time, I understood; but Silo
          laid his finger on his lip again,—cautiously lifted up a piece of
          the dark-red cloth with which this chamber was hung,—and essayed
          another spring in the pannelling beneath. Total darkness appeared
          to be beyond; but the jailer motioning to me to remain for a moment
          where I was, and to keep up the hanging, glided boldly into the
          recess. I wondered how he should tread so lightly, that I could not
          perceive the least echo; but this no longer surprised me, when I
          had the sign to follow. The floor felt beneath my foot as if it
          were stuffed like a pillow; and, after I had dropped the hanging,
          every thing was totally dark, as it had at first appeared to me,
          except only at certain points, separate and aloft, which let in
          gleams of light, manifestly artificial. Silo, taking hold of me by
          the hand, conducted me up some steps towards the nearest of these
          tiny apertures; and, as I approached it, I heard distinctly the
          voices of persons talking together in the room beyond. I did not
          draw my breath, you may well believe, with much boldness; but my
          eye was soon fixed at one of the crevices, and, after the first
          dazzle was over, I saw clearly. Silo took his station by my side,
          gazing through another of these loop-holes, which, that you may
          understand every thing, were evidently quite concealed among the
          rich carved-work of an ivory cornice.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chamber was
          lighted by three tall candelabra of silver, close beside one of
          which was placed a long table covered with an infinity of scrolls
          and tablets. One person, who had his back turned towards us, was
          writing, and two others, in one of whom I instantly <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>recognized the Emperor, were walking up
          and down on the other side.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, Palma,”</span> said Trajan, for it was that old
          favourite whom he addressed—<span class="tei tei-q">“I have made up
          my mind as to this matter. I shall never permit any curious
          inquisition as to private opinion. Every man has a right, without
          question, to think—to believe—exactly what pleases him; and I shall
          concede as much in favour of every woman, Palma, if you will have
          it so. But it is totally a different affair, when the fact, no
          matter how, is forced upon my knowledge, that a subject, no matter
          who or what he be—a subject of the Roman empire, refuses to comply
          with the first, the elemental, and the most essential of the laws.
          The man—aye or the woman—that confesses in my presence contempt for
          the deities whom the commonwealth acknowledges in every step of its
          procedure—that person is a criminal; and I cannot dismiss him
          unpunished, without injuring the commonwealth by the display of
          weakness in its chief. As for these poor fanatics themselves, it is
          the penalty of my station that I must control my
          feelings.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But you are satisfied, my lord,”</span> said Palma,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that these people are quite innocent as to
          Cotilius’s designs; and as it was upon that suspicion they were
          apprehended, perhaps it may be possible——”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes, Palma,”</span> interrupted the Prince;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“quite possible and quite easy, provided
          they will condescend to save themselves by the most trivial
          acknowledgment of the sort which, I repeat to you, I do and must
          consider as absolutely necessary. And women too—and girls
          forsooth—I suppose you would have me wait till the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>very urchins on the street were
          gathering into knots to discuss the nature of the Gods.—Do you
          remember what Plato says?”</span>—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, my lord, I do not know to what you
          refer.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Why, Plato says that nobody can ever understand any
          thing accurately about the Deity, and that, if he could, he would
          have no right to communicate his discoveries to others; the passage
          is in the Timæus, and Tully has translated it besides. And is it to
          be endured that these modest fanatics are to do every hour what the
          Platos and the Ciceros spoke of in such terms as these? I think you
          carry your tolerance a little farther than might have been expected
          from a disciple of the Academy.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I despise them, my lord, as much as yourself; but, to
          tell you the truth, it is this young lady that moves me to speak
          thus—and I crave your pardon, if I have spoken with too much
          freedom.—Her father was one of the best soldiers Titus
          had.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The more is the pity, Palma. Have you ever seen the
          girl yourself? Did you give orders that she should be brought
          hither? I have not the least objection that you should have half an
          hour, or an hour if you will, to talk with her quietly; perhaps
          your eloquence may have the effect we desire.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I doubt it, my lord, I greatly doubt it,”</span> he
          replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“but, indeed, I know not whether
          she be yet here—Did you not send to the Mammertine?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The man writing
          at the table, to whom this interrogation was addressed, said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe, sir, both this lady and the old
          man that was in the same prison are now in attendance.”</span> And
          upon this Trajan and Palma <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>retired together towards the farther end of
          the apartment, where they conversed for some minutes in a tone so
          low, that I could not understand any thing of what was said. Trajan
          at length turned from his favourite with an air, as I thought, of
          some little displeasure, and said aloud, coming back into the
          middle of the room,—<span class="tei tei-q">“I know it is so; but
          what is that to the affair in hand? I am very sorry for the
          Sempronii, but I doubt if even they would be so unreasonable as you
          are.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Will you not see the poor girl yourself,
          Cæsar?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You do not need to be told, that my seeing her would
          only make it more difficult for me to do that, which, seeing or not
          seeing her, I know to be my duty. Do you accept of my proposal? Are
          you willing to try the effect of your own persuasion? I promise
          you, if you succeed, I shall rejoice not less heartily than
          yourself; but it is rather too much to imagine that I am personally
          to interfere about such an affair as this—an affair which, the more
          I think of it, seems to me to be the more perfectly contemptible.
          Nay, do not suppose it is this poor girl I am talking of—I mean the
          whole of this Jewish, this Christian affair, which does indeed
          appear to me to be the most bare-faced absurdity, that ever was
          permitted to disturb the tranquillity of the empire. A mean and
          savage nation have but just suffered the penalty of obstinacy and
          treachery alike unequalled, and from them—from the scattered embers
          of this extinguished fire, we are to allow a new flame to be
          kindled—ay, and that in the very centre of Rome. I tell you, that
          if my own hand were to be scorched in the cause, I would disperse
          this combustion to the winds of heaven; I tell you, that I stand
          here <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name=
          "Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Cæsar, and that I
          would rather be chained to the oar, than suffer, while the power to
          prevent it is mine, the tiniest speck to be thrown upon the Roman
          majesty. By all the Gods, Palma, it is enough to make a man sick to
          think of the madness that is in this world, and of the iron
          arguments by which we are compelled to keep those from harming us,
          that at first sight of them excite no feeling but our pity. But I
          am weary of these very names of Palestine—Jew—Christian. Go to this
          foolish girl, and try what you can make of her; I give you fair
          warning—no breeders of young Christians here.”</span></p>

          VII.</span></span></h1>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cornelius Palma,
          after the Prince retired, was apparently for some space busied with
          his reflections. He then talked in a whispering manner with the
          secretary, and moved towards an extremity of the chamber. But the
          moment Silo perceived this, he plucked my sleeve, and drew me to
          the other end of our closet, where, as I have told you, the light
          had admittance in a similar manner. Here another of the imperial
          apartments was visible in equal distinctness; and in it appeared
          Athanasia and her friend, as waiting now at length in entire
          composure the moment when they should be summoned.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Palma entering,
          both rose, and he, returning their salutation, remained before them
          for a moment in silence, his eyes fixed on Athanasia. It was to
          Aurelius, nevertheless, that his first words were
          addressed:—<span class="tei tei-q">“From what has been reported of
          your behaviour at the execution of Cotilius, I fear there is
          nothing to be gained by speaking to <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span>,
          concerning the only means by which your own safety can yet be
          secured. You are obstinate, old man, in your
          superstition?”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Noble Palma,”</span>
          said the priest, <span class="tei tei-q">“contempt is the only
          thing I fear from men. But I thank my <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>God, that it is the only thing I have it in my
          power to avoid.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I will not argue
          with you,”</span> answered Palma, pointing to a door near
          him:—<span class="tei tei-q">“It was not with any purpose of
          bending you, that I undertook this painful office. I desire to
          speak in freedom with one whose case is, I trust, less
          hopeless.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old man,
          pointing to his fetters, said meekly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let
          them guard me whither it pleases you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> said Athanasia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I pray you let Aurelius remain; imagine not that I
          shall either hear or answer less freely because of my friend’s
          presence.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He will, at least, retire to the other end of the
          chamber,”</span> said Palma—<span class="tei tei-q">“and interfere
          no farther.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The priest drew
          back;—Athanasia, on her part, seeing that Palma hesitated, and
          seemed at a loss how to begin, said to him in a tone of modest
          composure:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Noble sir, if your purpose be
          indeed as kind as I think it is, I pray you spare me at least the
          pain that is needless, and spare yourself what I am sure is painful
          to you. You see my youth and my sex, and it is not unnatural for
          you to think as you do; but know that my faith is fixed, and that I
          hope I shall not be deserted, when I strive even at the last moment
          to do it no dishonour.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“This gray beard,”</span> said Palma, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“has made you, then, thoroughly a
          Christian?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I would it were so,”</span> she answered—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I would to God it were so!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady,”</span> resumed Palma, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“we have knowledge both of your father’s high
          character, and of your own amiable dispositions. If you persist in
          this manner, you will give grief to Cæsar; and as for your family,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name=
          "Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have you yet
          seriously considered into what misery they must be
          plunged?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> she replied, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“this is cruel kindness. I have considered all
          things.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Young maiden,”</span> continued Palma, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the touch of the physician’s knife is painful, yet his
          hand must not falter. But I have sent for those, who, I hope, may
          speak more effectually.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Senator
          turned from the pedestal on which he had been leaning, and walked
          to the door over against where Aurelius was sitting: and after a
          moment had elapsed, there entered, even as I had anticipated, both
          her uncles, Lucius and Velius. Behind them came, wrapped in her
          consecrated veil, the Priestess of Apollo; and last of all, gazing
          wildly around, her apparel disordered, the friend of her youth, the
          sister of her bosom,—she to whom in all things, save one,
          Athanasia’s heart had ever been laid open. The two Patricians
          advanced, deeply dejected, towards the place where Athanasia stood
          waiting their approach. The stately Priestess, walking yet more
          slowly, lifted the veil from her face, which was pale and calm as
          marble. But when the youthful companion at last rested her eye upon
          her friend, and the fettered hands clasped together on that bosom,
          she rushed past them all, and was folded in a cold embrace; for
          though Athanasia pressed Sempronia to her bosom, I saw also that
          she trembled from head to foot, and that her eyes were riveted on
          those who approached with seriousness more terrible than the
          passion of young sympathy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Athanasia,”</span> said Lucius, taking her by the
          hand, <span class="tei tei-q">“look not upon us thus; we come as to
          a daughter.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg
          331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dearest,”</span> said old Velius, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“listen to thy true friends. Do you put more faith in
          the words of strangers than in the blood of kindred—the affection
          of your father’s brothers—the guardians of his dear
          orphan?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Wo is me!”</span> said Athanasia—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O God, strengthen me! Why, oh, why am I forced to
          wound these kind hearts! Have pity upon me, have pity upon me—you
          know not what you speak of, else you would all be
          silent.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Weep,”</span> said the Priestess; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“weep, and weep largely. There is yet time to repent.
          Abjure this madness; let the last of your tears be shed upon the
          altars of your paternal Gods, and they also will be merciful. Nay,
          tremble not when you hear my voice, Athanasia. I love you as
          tenderly as the rest, and if you have deceived me also, I have long
          since pardoned.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Priestess
          kissed her forehead; and she bowed her head, weeping at length
          audibly. But Athanasia speedily recovered herself, and gently
          removing the hands of Sempronia, stood erect again in the
          midst.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dear friends,”</span> said she, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the moments you have to be with me are numbered; what
          avails it that they should be spent in words that can have no
          effect? I have been baptized in the name of the one true God—I have
          partaken of the symbols of the Christian mystery—and I have no more
          power to bring myself out of this peril, than he that stands in the
          front rank—without sword or buckler—deprived of all things but his
          honour.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Athanasia!”</span> said Velius, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“alas! my dear girl, what madness is this? Do you hold
          yourself wiser than all the wise men, and all the good, and all the
          great men <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg
          332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>that have ever lived in Rome? Do you deem
          yourself able to penetrate mysteries from which all the sages of
          the earth have retreated with humility? Consider with
          yourself—remember the modesty that might be becoming in your tender
          years—and, I must speak the truth, your ignorance.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Oh, sir!”</span> she answered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“believe not that I have been brought into this place,
          because of my being puffed up with emptiness of conceit. I know
          well that I am a poor, young, unlearned creature; but God gives not
          according to our deserts; and because I am poor and ignorant, must
          I therefore reject the promise of his riches, and the great light
          that has been manifested to me,—which, would to God it had also
          been to you, despite the perils which a dark world has thrown
          around it.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O Athanasia!”</span> said young Sempronia,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I know the secrets of your heart, although
          you have kept from me some of them. Think, dear sister, of all the
          love that we bear to you—and, oh! think of Valerius.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The more, then, is the sacrifice!”</span> said
          Athanasia. <span class="tei tei-q">“Caius Valerius also is a
          Christian—at least I hope in God he will soon be sealed into our
          brotherhood.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Amen! amen!”</span> said Aurelius.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Priestess
          turned round when he uttered this, and observing that he also was
          fettered, <span class="tei tei-q">“Blasphemer!”</span> cried she,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“behold the end of your frenzy. Your eyes
          are dim, your clay is already yearning, it may be, to be sprinkled
          into ashes; but behold your victim. Ye Gods that see all things,
          have mercy upon the errors of deceived, ensnared, murdered youth!
          Hoary Apostate! feeble though you be, may strength be given to you
          in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name=
          "Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>anger, that you may
          taste the full struggle and the true agony. May you be strong to
          wrestle, that you may fall slowly, and feel your fall! Would to the
          Gods, just and merciful, that you might struggle and fall
          alone!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Rash woman,”</span> said the manacled Saint,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“most surely your last wish is mine. But
          why is it that you have come hither with cruel words, to imbitter
          equally the last moments of a life that is dear to you, and a life
          that you despise? You speak of ignorance and of deceit. Little know
          ye who are the deceived. We are the servants of the living God,
          whose light will soon shine abroad among the nations, and quench
          glimmering tapers, fashioned with the hands of men, with which,
          hitherto, ye have sat contented amidst darkness. Cæsar may bind and
          slay—but think ye that the spirit is his to do with it what he
          will? Think ye that chains and dungeons, and the sword of man can
          alter the course of things that are to be, or shake from its
          purpose the will of Him, in whom, blind and ignorant, ye refuse to
          behold the image of the Maker of all—shutting eyes, and ears, and
          your proud hearts; and blaspheming against the God of heaven, whose
          glory ye ascribe to stocks and stones, and to the ghosts of wicked
          and bloody tyrants, long since mouldered into dust,—and to the sun,
          and the moon, and the stars of the sky, which God set there to rule
          the day and the night, even as he lets loose his winds to scatter
          the leaves of the forest, and to lift up the waves of the great
          deep?—Leave us, I beseech you.—The young and the old are alike
          steadfast, for God is our strength, and he bestows it on them that
          ask for it in the name of the Redeemer.”</span></p><span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“I serve the altar, and came not hither to
          hear the Gods of heaven and earth insulted by the lips of hardened
          impiety.—Athanasia! will you go with us, or will you stay here, and
          partake the fate of this madman?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“O God!”</span> cried the maiden; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“how shall I speak that they may at length hear
          me!—Friends—dear friends—if you have any love, any compassion, I
          pray you kiss me once, and bid me farewell kindly, and lay my ashes
          in the sepulchre of my fathers—beside the urn of my mother. Fear
          not that I will disturb the repose of the place—I shall die in
          anger against no one, and I shall have rest at length when I am
          relieved from this struggle. Pardon, if in any thing besides I ever
          gave you pain—remember none of my offences but this—think of me
          kindly. And go now, dear friends; kiss my lips in love, and leave
          me to bear that which must be borne, since there is no escape but
          in lying, and in baseness, and in utter perdition here and
          hereafter. May the Lord strengthen his day soon, and may ye all
          bless the full light, although now ye are startled by the redness
          of the dawn! Farewell—kiss me, Velius—kiss me, Lucius—my aunt also
          will kiss me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They did kiss
          her, and tears were mingled with their embraces; and they said no
          more, but parted from her where she was. Palma himself lifted the
          desolate Sempronia from the ground, and he and her father carried
          her away senseless, her tresses sweeping the pavement as they
          moved.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prisoners
          were alone. <span class="tei tei-q">“The moment is come,”</span>
          said Silo; <span class="tei tei-q">“now, sir, prepare yourself to
          risk every thing where every thing may be
          gained.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg
          335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He did not
          whisper this, but spake the words boldly; and ere I could either
          answer any thing, or form any guess as to his meaning, he had
          leaped down from my side, and thrown open another secret spring.
          Silo rushed in, and I followed him. It was all done so rapidly,
          that I scarce remember how. I cannot, indeed, forget the wild and
          vacant stare of Athanasia, the cry which escaped from her lips, nor
          the fervour with which she sunk into my embrace. But all the rest
          is a dream. The door closed swiftly behind us;—swiftly I ran,
          bearing the maiden in my arms through all the long course of those
          deserted chambers. Door after door flew open before us. All alike,
          breathless and speechless, we ran on. We reached the last of the
          chambers, the wide and echoing saloon, ere my heart had recovered
          from the first palpitation of surprise; and a moment after we
          breathed once more the free air of heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Stop not,”</span> said I, <span class="tei tei-q">“for
          the sake of God. Hasten, Silo, it is you that must guide
          us.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Ha!”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“already have they perceived it? Great God!
          after all, is it in vain?”</span> We heard shout echoing shout, and
          the clapping of doors. <span class="tei tei-q">“Treachery,
          treachery! Escape, escape!”</span>—and trumpet and horn mingled in
          the clamour of surprise, wrath, terror. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ride, ride,”</span> screamed a voice high over all the
          tumult—<span class="tei tei-q">“ride this instant—guard every
          avenue—search every corner—the wing of Domitian!”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“We are lost,”</span> said Silo;—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“we can never reach the gate.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“To the Temple of Apollo!”</span> said I; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the Priestess will shelter Athanasia.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thank God,”</span> whispered Silo, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there is one chance <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>more.”</span>—And so we began again to run
          swiftly, keeping close beneath the shaded wall of the edifice, and
          then threading many narrow passages of the hanging gardens of
          Adonis, we reached indeed the adjoining court of the Palatine, and
          found ourselves, where all was as yet silent and undisturbed, under
          the sacred portico. The great gate was barred. Athanasia herself
          pointed out a postern, and we stood within the temple.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was filled as
          before, (for here the alternations of day and night made no
          difference,) with the soft and beautiful radiance proceeding from
          the tree of lamps. But the fire on the altar burned high and clear,
          as if recently trimmed, and behind its blaze stood one of the
          ministering damsels. Her hand held the chain of the censer, and she
          was swinging it slowly, while the clouds of fragrant smoke rolled
          high up above the flames;—and the near light, and the intervening
          smoke, and the occupation with which she was busied, prevented her
          from at first perceiving what intrusion had been made on the
          solitude of the place. Athanasia ran on, and clasping the knees of
          the astonished girl with her fettered hands, began to implore her
          by the memory of old affection and companionship, and for the sake
          of all that was dear to her, to give escape, if escape were
          possible—at least to give concealment. The girl had dropped the
          censer from her hand, and seemed utterly confused, and unable to
          guess the meaning of what she saw and heard. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Lady!”</span> cried Silo, falling by the side of
          Athanasia—<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, lady! stand not here
          considering, for this is the very moment of utmost peril. Behold
          these fetters—they tell you from what her flight hath
          been.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg
          337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The girl grasped
          the hands of Athanasia, and gazed upon the manacles, and still
          seemed quite amazed and stupified; and while Silo was renewing his
          entreaties, we heard suddenly some one trying to open the postern
          which the freedman had fastened behind us. Once and again a violent
          hand essayed to undo the bolt, and then all was quiet again. And in
          a moment after, the great gate was itself thrown open, and the
          Priestess entered, followed by her two brothers, who supported
          between them the yet faint and weeping young Sempronia.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a moment
          Athanasia had rushed across the temple, and knelt down with her
          forehead to the ground, close by where the feet of her haughty
          kinswoman were planted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Unhappy!”</span> said she; <span class="tei tei-q">“by
          what magic do I behold you here? How have you escaped? and why—oh!
          why fled hither? Think ye, that here, in the Temple of Apollo, the
          priestess of an insulted God can give shelter to blasphemy flying
          from the arms of justice? Ha! and he, too, is here!—Outcast! how
          durst thou? Speak, unhappy Athanasia—every thing is dark, and I see
          only that you have brought hither——”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Friends, friends—oh! blame them not,”</span>
          interrupted the maiden—<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! blame them not
          for venturing all to save me. Oh! help us, and help speedily—for
          they search every where, and they may speedily be here.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Here?”</span> cried the priestess—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“who, I pray you? Ha! run, fly, bolt the door. If Cæsar
          speaks, I answer.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ring of
          arms, and voices of angry men, were heard distinctly approaching.
          In a moment more we could hear them talking together beneath the
          very portico, and trying, in their turn, to thrust open the massive
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name=
          "Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>valves of the temple.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Who calls there?”</span> cried the
          Priestess—<span class="tei tei-q">“Who calls and knocks? If a
          suppliant approaches, let him come as a
          suppliant.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Castor! We are no
          suppliants,”</span> answered a rough voice:—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dead or alive, you must give up our pretty Christians.
          Come, come, my sly masters; yield, yield, there is no flying from
          Cæsar.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace, insolent!”</span> quoth the
          Priestess—<span class="tei tei-q">“peace, and begone! This is the
          Temple of Apollo, and ye shall find no Christians here. Turn, rude
          man, and dread the arm that guarded Delphos!”</span> And saying so,
          she at length lifted up Athanasia, and moved towards the other
          extremity of the fane, where, as I had occasion once to tell you
          before, the private chamber of the Priestess was situated on the
          right hand beyond the statue of Apollo. In passing the image she
          halted an instant, laid her hand on her eyes, and kissed its feet,
          with a murmur of supplication; but that was her only utterance: and
          the rest gave none.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She thus led us
          across the chamber in which, on a former day, I had heard Athanasia
          sing; and in like manner, having taken a lamp in her hand, on
          through the long passages which conduct towards the receptacle
          wherein the Sybilline prophecies are said to be preserved. She
          opened the door which she had, on that earlier day, told me led
          into the repository of those mysterious scrolls. Two inner doors
          appeared before us; that to the left she opened likewise, and we
          perceived, descending from its threshold, a dark flight of steps,
          as if down into the centre of the rock.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Here,”</span> said she, as she paused, and held the
          lamp over the gloomy perspective—<span class="tei tei-q">“here, at
          last, I leave <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg
          339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>you, having already done too much, whether I
          think of the God I serve, or of Trajan, or of myself. But for the
          blood of kindred not little may be dared. Go with her, since you
          have come with her. More I cannot do. Here—take this lamp; the door
          at the bottom is fastened only from within; let it fall behind you,
          and make what speed you may.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“One thing,”</span> said Silo, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“had better be done ere you depart;”</span> and so,
          very adroitly, he, by means of his jailer’s key, relieved both of
          them from their fetters. He then whispered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Go no farther, Valerius; you may rest assured that no
          one suspects us.”</span> I saw that he designed to return into the
          courts of the Palatine, and so proceed homewards, as if ignorant of
          every thing that had occurred. The good freedman had no other
          course to pursue, either in duty to himself or to his family. But
          for me, all my cares were here. I squeezed by the hand both Lucius
          and Velius, and both warmly returned my pressure. The Priestess
          gave the lamp into my hand, and the door was shut upon us; and we
          began, with hearts full of thankfulness, but not yet composed
          enough to taste of lightness—with thankfulness uppermost in our
          confused thoughts, and with no steady footsteps, to descend into
          the unknown abyss.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The steps were
          abrupt and narrow; but in a few minutes our feet became accustomed
          to them, and we descended rapidly. After we had done so for some
          time, we found ourselves in a low chamber of oblong form, in the
          midst of which an iron stake was fixed into the floor, having
          chains of ponderous workmanship attached to its centre, and over
          against it, a narrow chair of the same metal, it also immoveable. I
          asked Athanasia to repose herself here for a moment; for it was
          evident that the tumultuous evening had much worn out her strength.
          But she said, shuddering, <span class="tei tei-q">“No, not here,
          Valerius; I never saw this place before, but the aspect of it
          recals to me fearful stories. Here, wo is me, many a poor wretch
          has expiated offences against the dignity of the shrine, and the
          servants of its Demon. My father knows, I doubt not, some humble
          Christian roof, beneath which we may be safe until the first search
          be over. Let us breathe at least the open air, and He who has
          hitherto helped will not desert us.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“No, my children,”</span> said Aurelius; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“let us not linger here. Christian roofs, indeed, are
          known to me, both humble and lofty; but how to know how far
          suspicion may already have extended?—or why should we run any
          needless risk of bringing others into peril, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>having by God’s grace escaped ourselves,
          when all hope as to this life had been utterly taken away? Let us
          quit these foul precincts—let us quit them speedily—but let us not
          rashly be seen in the busy city. There is a place known to me, (and
          Athanasia also has visited it heretofore,) where safety, I think,
          may be expected, and where, if danger do come, it shall find no
          unnecessary victim. Let us hasten to the Esquiline.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Thanks, father!”</span> said Athanasia; <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there no one will seek us: there best shall our
          thanksgivings and our prayers be offered. We will rest by the
          sepulchre of our friend, and Valerius will go into the city, and
          procure what things are needful.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We began the
          descent of another flight of steps, beyond the dark chamber. This
          terminated at length in a door, the bolts of which being withdrawn,
          we found ourselves beneath the sky of night, at the extremity of
          one of the wooded walks that skirt the southern base of the
          Palatine—the remains of the Assyrian magnificence which had once
          connected the Golden House of Nero with the more modest structures
          of his predecessors. I wrapped Athanasia in my cloak, and walked
          beside her in my tunic; and Aurelius conducted us by many windings,
          avoiding as far as was possible the glare of the Suburra, all round
          about the edge of the city, to the gardens which hang over the wall
          by the great Esquiline Gate.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Is it here,”</span> said I, when he
          paused—<span class="tei tei-q">“is it in the midst of this
          splendour that you hope to find a safe obscurity?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Have patience,”</span> replied the old man;
          <span class="tei tei-q">“you are a stranger:—and yet you speak what
          I should have heard <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg
          342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>without surprise from many that have spent all
          their days in Rome. Few, indeed, ever think of entering a region
          which is almost as extensive as the city itself, and none, I think,
          are acquainted with all its labyrinths.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So saying, the
          priest led the way into one of the groves. Its trees formed a dense
          canopy overhead; nor could we pass without difficulty among the
          close-creeping undergrowth. At length we reached the centre of the
          wide thicket, and found a small space of soil comparatively bare.
          The light of moon and star plunged down there among the surrounding
          blackness of boughs, as into some deep well, and shewed the
          entrance of a natural grotto, which had, indeed, all the appearance
          of oblivion and utter desertedness. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Confess,”</span> said he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that I did not deceive you. But there is no hurry now;
          let me taste once more the water of this forgotten
          spring.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had not
          observed a small fountain hard by the mouth of the grotto, which,
          in former days, had evidently been much cared for, although now
          almost all its surface was covered with leaves. The marble margin
          shewed dim with moss; nor had a statue just within the entrance of
          the grot escaped this desolation. Damp herbage obscured its
          recumbent limbs, and the Parian stone had lost its brightness.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You can scarcely see where the inscription
          was,”</span> said Aurelius, <span class="tei tei-q">“for the

          flat piece of marble among the weeds. I was advancing to examine
          the stone, but the old man stopped me:—<span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Athanasia
          meantime had sat down by the grotto, and was laving her forehead
          with the water of the solitary fountain. Aurelius, too, dipped his
          hands in the well, and tasted of the water, and then turning to me,
          he said, with a grave smile, <span class="tei tei-q">“Valerius,
          methinks you are religious in your regard for the slumbers of the
          nymph.”</span> He whispered something into the ear of Athanasia,
          and received an answer from her in the same tone, ere he
          proceeded:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Draw near—fear not that I shall
          do any thing rashly—we owe all things <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          plainly.—Do you indeed desire to be admitted into the fellowship of
          the true Faith? Let not the symbol of regeneration be applied
          hastily. Without doubt, great were my joy might my hands be
          honoured to shed the blessed water of baptism upon the brow of dear
          Valerius.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Caius,”</span> said Athanasia, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I know God has touched your heart; why should this be
          delayed any longer? You have shared the perils of the faithful.
          Partake with them in good as in evil. Hesitate no longer; God will
          perfect what hath been so begun.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Dearest friends!”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“if I hesitate, it is only because I doubt if I am yet
          worthy. Surely I believe that this is the right faith, and that
          there is no God but He whom you worship.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Acceptable is humility in the sight of Heaven,”</span>
          said the priest; and he rose up from the place where he had been
          sitting, and began, standing by the margin of the well, to pour out
          words of thanksgiving and supplication, such as I have never heard
          equalled by any lips but his. The deep calm voice of the holy man
          sounded both sweet and awful in the breathless air of midnight. The
          tall black trees stood all around, like a wall, cutting us off from
          the world, and from the thoughts of the world; and the moon, steady
          in the serene sky, seemed to shower down light and beauty upon
          nothing in all the wide earth, but that little guarded space of our
          seclusion. I stepped into the cool water of the fountain. The old
          man stooped over me, and sprinkled the drops upon my forehead, and
          the appointed words were repeated. Aurelius kissed my brow, as I
          came forth from the water, and Athanasia also drew slowly
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name=
          "Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>near, and then
          hastily she pressed my forehead with trembling lips.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We sate down
          together by the lonely well; and we sate in silence, for I could
          not be without many thoughts partaken by none but myself, at the
          moment when I had thus, in the face of God and man, abjured the
          faith of all my fathers, and passed into the communion of the
          despised and persecuted Few; nor did either the priest or Athanasia
          essay to disturb my meditations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were
          moments (for I must not conceal from you my weakness) in which I
          could scarcely help suspecting that I had done something that was
          wrong. I thought of my far distant mother; and I could not reflect
          without pain upon the feelings with which I had every reason to
          suppose that she, kind as she was, and merciful in all things,
          would have contemplated the scene which had passed. I thought of my
          dead parent too; and that was yet more serious and awful. The
          conviction of my own mind, in obedience to which I had acted,
          relieved me, however, from any feelings of self-reproach.—My father
          is dead, said I to myself—He died in ignorance, and he has not been
          judged according to the light, which never shone upon him. But
          now—Oh, yes! it must be so—the darkness has passed from before his
          eyes; and, if the spirits of the departed ever visit, in the dim
          hours of silence, those who were dear to them upon this earth,
          surely his venerable shade stood by smiling while the forehead of
          his son was laved with these blessed waters.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meantime,
          minutes—hours, perhaps, glided away, while troubled, and solemn,
          and tender thoughts thus occupied by turns my bosom. The old priest
          sate by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg
          346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>me, his arms folded on his breast, gazing
          upwards upon the spangled glories of the firmament. Athanasia was
          on the other side, close by the statue of the Sleeping Naiad. From
          time to time, she too would fix her eyes for a moment upon the
          untroubled beauty of the moon; and then, stooping over the brink of
          the fountain, once and again I saw its calm dark waters rippled
          beneath her by the dropping of a tear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My children,”</span> said, at length, Aurelius,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“methinks more sadness is amongst us than
          might suit the remembrance of what Providence has done for us,
          since the sun that went down upon fear and sorrow is about to rise
          upon many fair hopes. I am old; the world lies behind me, save a
          remnant I know not how brief. It lies all before you, and you have
          a light whereby to look upon it, which my early day wanted. I trust
          that soon, very soon, ye shall both be far from this city—I say
          both, for I know well, go where ye may, ye will go together. As for
          me, my lot is cast here, and here I will remain. Caius, you must
          leave us betimes—you must return into the city, and consult with
          your friends and hers, how best Athanasia may be conveyed safely
          beyond the bounds of Italy. Cæsar, indeed, rules every where; but
          at a distance from Rome suspicion is, at least, less watchful; and
          there is no precept given by which ye are bound to seek unnecessary
          perils.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Aurelius,”</span> said I—<span class="tei tei-q">“dear
          father, think not but that I have already been considering all
          these things anxiously. As soon as I have seen you safely placed
          within the retreat of which you have spoken, I shall hasten to
          Licinius, my kinsman, who already, indeed, must be feeling no small
          anxiety from my absence. I <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>shall speak with him, and with both the
          Sempronii. My own errand to the capital I value as nothing, and I
          shall be ready on the instant, if Athanasia herself will consent to
          partake my voyage.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Yes, Caius,”</span> said the father—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“this child of God will be your wife, and ye will both
          serve the Lord many days, amidst the quiet valleys of your far off
          island.—Nay, daughter, do not weep, for these are not common days,
          and you must follow without fear the path which God’s providence
          points out. Before ye go, my children, I myself shall join your
          hands in the name of our God.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Athanasia heard
          his words, and saw me gaze upon his face, but she made no reply,
          except by the tears which Aurelius rebuked, and a timid, yet grave
          and serious pressure, with which she, when he had made an end of
          speaking, returned the fervid pressure of my hand upon hers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Children,”</span> said the old man, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“there is no need of words when hearts are open—the
          tears that ye have shed together are the best earnest of the vows
          that ye shall ere long, I trust, pronounce. Yet, let no rashness
          attend your steps. The dawn must now be near, and Athanasia and I
          had better retire into our protecting covert. Valerius will leave
          us, and return at eventide. Till then, fasting and praying, we
          shall give thanks for our deliverance, and ask the aid that alone
          is precious for the time that yet remains.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I had,
          fortunately, brought all the way with me the lamp which lighted our
          steps down the mysterious staircase, from the shrine of Apollo.
          Some little oil still remained within it, and Aurelius soon struck
          a light, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg
          348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>and, taking it in his hand, began to enter
          before us the dark cavern, by the mouth of which we had all this
          while been sitting. You, perhaps, have never heard of those strange
          excavations, the whole extent of which has probably never been
          known to any one person, but which appear, indeed, as the priest
          had said, to be almost co-extensive with the great city beneath
          which they are placed. For what purpose they were at first dug, is
          a subject which has long exercised the conjectures of those fond of
          penetrating into the origin of things, and the customs of
          antiquity. By some it is supposed, that in such caverns, winding
          far away into unseen recesses, the first rude inhabitants of Italy,
          like the Troglodytes of Upper Egypt and Ethiopia, had fixed their
          miserable abodes. Others assert, that they owe their origin merely
          to the elder builders of the visible Rome, who, to avoid marring
          the surface of the earth, were contented to bring their materials
          of sand, clay, and stone, from these subterraneous labyrinths,
          which so grew with the progress of diligence, and with the
          extension of the city itself. Perhaps both conjectures may have
          some foundation in truth; but be that as it may, there is no
          question, that, in succeeding times, these catacombs had been
          widened and extended, to serve as places of burial for the mortal
          remains of the poor citizens. And now is it to be wondered at, that
          here, in regions so obscure and dismal, the persecuted adherents of
          the Faith should have frequently sought not only resting-places for
          the bodies of their dead, but even shelter for themselves, amidst
          the terror of those relentless days? Hither, more than once, the
          aged priest said, he had fled to escape the pursuit of his
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name=
          "Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>enemies—here once
          more he hoped the shield of safety would lie over his peril—here,
          at last, by whatever death he should die, his brethren had promised
          to lay his bones in the earth, beside Tisias of Antioch, and many
          more that, in the bloody times of Nero and Domitian, had already,
          in the sight of all that heartless city, merited the crown, and the
          spotless robe, and the palm-branch of martyrdom, by patient
          endurance of the last insolence of man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our father,
          therefore, held the lamp before us, and we entered those gloomy
          regions, wherein alone the servants of the Son of God could at that
          troubled era esteem themselves in safety from the hot pursuit of
          contemptuous power. We passed along beneath the arches of the
          rock-hewn roof, and between the endless winding walls, on either
          side of which appeared many humble inscriptions, recording the
          virtues of the departed and the regrets of the surviving poor. Of
          these last, however, as it appeared, all must long since have been
          gathered to the ashes of those they lamented, for there was no
          semblance of any new monument among all that we observed, and most
          of them, to judge from the shape of the letters upon them, must
          have been set up at least as long ago as the period of Asinius.
          After traversing many of these subterraneous galleries, we came, at
          last, to one more low-roofed than the rest, into which Aurelius
          struck aside, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Here Tisias lies,
          but no inscription marks the place where a martyr finds repose.
          Here is the spot; with my own hands I lent feeble help in digging
          the grave. Athanasia, too, knows it well, for she also did not fear
          to assist in rendering the last honours to that soldier of
          Christ.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg
          350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A flat thin
          stone, without mark or epitaph, indicated the spot.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> said Athanasia, <span class=

          fear no evil. Conduct Caius back to the grotto; it is time he
          should go.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus leaving her
          by the funeral-stone, Aurelius and I retraced our steps to the
          mouth of the catacomb.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          with all speed the house of your kinsman. Go, my son; may all
          blessings attend your steps. Come back at the rising of the moon,
          and cast a stone into the fountain, and I shall be within hearing.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I passed without
          disturbance through the gardens of the Esquiline, and the streets
          of the city, in which no one was as yet moving, except a few
          rustics driving asses laden with herbs to the market-place. When I
          reached the house of my kinsman, however, it was evident that sleep
          did not prevail within its gates; lights were visible in the
          vestibule, and there I found several of the slaves sitting in
          conversation. My own could not conceal the extravagance of his
          satisfaction on seeing me enter among them in safety; so that I had
          no doubt his brother had informed him, in so far at least, of what
          had passed after our leaving him in the Mammertine. Dromo received
          me also with warm demonstrations of joy, and conducted me to the
          chamber of Licinius, in which, with the orator himself, were
          Sextus, pale with watching, Sabinus, still habited in military
          attire, with a goblet of wine before him on the table, and Lucius
          Sempronius, who was reclining at some little distance from the
          rest. It was he that eagerly began to question me; and I perceived
          from the style in which he spoke, that all present had already been
          made aware of the manner in which Athanasia had been withdrawn from
          the council-chamber. A few words informed them <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of what had followed after we quitted
          the Temple of Apollo.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I thank the gods,”</span> said
          Sempronius,—<span class="tei tei-q">“so far at least it goes
          well—but if this strictness, of which the Centurion speaks, shall
          be adhered to, there still must be no small difficulty about
          conveying her beyond the city.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In truth,”</span> quoth Sabinus, after a little pause,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid this is scarcely a matter in
          regard to which I should be consulted. I know not but already I
          have done several things that could not be quite reconciled with my
          duty. I shall, in all probability, be set on the watch myself, and
          if so—much as I must regret the necessity—it certainly will be most
          necessary for me to discharge what is committed to my trust. Is
          there no possibility, think you, of inventing some impenetrable
          disguise? Depend on it, it is quite impossible the young lady
          should remain any where in Rome, without being ere long discovered.
          The first thing is to have her safe beyond the
          city-walls.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I myself,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“shall embark instantly for Britain. Sempronius,
          Athanasia must go with me—Surely it may be possible to have her
          carried unobserved to the shore.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Every thing that Cneius left is your own.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          But come, here is health to the heir of the Valerii, and may this

          gravity.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg
          353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Would to heaven!”</span> said Sempronius, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“our young friend had loved under other auspices! No,
          Valerius must stay and take possession, destined, as I hope he is,
          to equal, under the favour of the gods, the noblest name in his
          lineage. My dear niece—let us trust she may be concealed somewhere
          in safety from the pursuit. Separated from this fanatic crew, she
          will, ere long, without question, abandon the dreams they have
          filled her mind withal; and on some happier day, our friend may
          perhaps have no reason either to fear or to blush, for lifting her
          over the threshold of the Valerii.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I drew near to
          the old man, and, receiving his embrace, whispered into his ear,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sempronius, you speak generously; but know
          that this very evening I also have become a Christian.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Heavens!”</span> cried he, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what limits shall be affixed to this contagion! Rash
          boy! have you not seen already to what consequences this must
          lead?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“What?”</span> says Licinius—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“what new calamity is this? Have my ears deceived me?
          Speak, dear Caius—for the sake of all the blood in your veins—you
          have not embraced this frenzy?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My friends,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“why should I speak to one, when all of you are, I well
          know, alike interested? In all things else I bow to age and
          understanding so much above my own; but here I have thought for
          myself, and my faith is fixed.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Licinius heard
          me with a countenance of painful and anxious emotion. In the eye of
          young Sextus I saw a tear ready to start, and his whole aspect was
          that of one sad and bewildered. Sempronius leaned his brow upon his
          hand, and turned himself away from me. But as <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for the Centurion, he preserved his
          usual air; and after a moment, all the rest continuing silent,
          said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Valerius, I have been in love ere
          now, and perhaps am not out of the scrape at present; but you have
          thrown a new light upon the matter. What do you fancy to be the
          great merits of the present age, that it should be treated with
          more favour than all that have gone before it? And, if you come to
          speak of the Jews, every body knows they are a most pitiful, mean,
          knavish set of creatures. They were always by the ears among
          themselves; but I think it is rather too much that they should have
          the credit of bringing their betters (by which I mean all the world
          besides) into confusion. You are but green yet; all this will blow
          over anon, and you will laugh more heartily than any one else when
          you think of your weakness. But look up, good friend, I don’t think
          you are listening to me.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“My dear Sabinus,”</span> said I, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I do listen, but I think it is rather to the gay
          Prætorian, than to the patient friend I had expected to find in
          you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Come!”</span> said he again, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“you take every thing so seriously. If you are resolved
          to be a Christian, I am very sorry for it; but even that shall not
          stand between me and a true friend. I hope you will soon see the
          thing as I do—I know you will; but, in the meantime, Valerius, you
          may count upon me.”</span>—And the kind man squeezed my hand with
          his customary fervour.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He then turned
          round to the rest of our friends, and began to propose for their
          consideration a dozen different schemes of escape, that had already
          suggested themselves to his imagination.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Licinius took
          advantage of the first pause, to suggest that the Centurion seemed
          in a hurry to get rid of me. He then passed into an account of the
          speech he had delivered on the preceding afternoon before the Court
          of the Centumvirs, and of the unhesitating manner, so gratifying to
          his feelings, in which its judgment had been pronounced. For some
          moments, in his detail of these proceedings, he seemed almost to
          have lost sight of the present situation and views of the person
          most interested in their termination. But when, in the progress of
          his story, he came to enlarge upon the magnificence of my new
          possessions—the domains in Africa—the rich farms in Sicily—the
          numerous slaves engaged in their cultivation—the Spanish silver
          mine—and, last of all, the splendours of the great villa upon the
          banks of the Tiber—it was not difficult to perceive that he could
          scarcely restrain his indignation at the purpose I had been
          expressing. <span class="tei tei-q">“And such,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“are the realities which our young friend
          quits for the reasons he has mentioned! Well, every man must judge
          for himself. If it must be so, let it be so.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I heard him
          patiently to the end, and then said, <span class="tei tei-q">“You
          have well summed up the whole matter, my dear Licinius. It must
          indeed be so. I go immediately to Britain, and I trust she—for whom
          I would leave all these things, were they greater than they
          are—shall, by the aid of your kindness, go with me in safety. There
          is one request only which I have, in addition to all this, to lay
          before you; and that you may hear it the more patiently, it does
          not concern myself.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In a word, then,”</span> I continued, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“should happier days arrive, I hope once more to be
          among you here in Rome. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg
          356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>The wealth which, thanks to your zeal,
          Licinius, is this day mine, can be of little use to me in the
          British valley, to which, for the present, I retire. Above all,
          this beautiful villa of which you speak,—why, because for a time I
          am unable to occupy it, should the mansion of my fathers stand
          empty, when there are others among their descendants, who lie not
          under the same necessity of exile? Till I am enabled to breathe in
          freedom the air of Italy, I trust Licinius will consent to let
          Sextus represent me in my villa. There, too, I hope Sempronius will
          permit his daughter to be. It will give pleasure to Athanasia, to
          think that those halls contain the dearest of our friends. When we
          come back, if ever we do so, they will not grudge to make room for
          us beneath the same roof with themselves. Licinius—Sempronius—what
          say you?”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were both
          silent for a moment; but Sabinus was at hand to answer for
          them:—<span class="tei tei-q">“By all Olympus! I shall knock down
          any man henceforth, that in my presence abuses Christianity as a
          destruction of men’s hearts. Let it be, good friends, as our Caius
          says. I know, Sextus, I have at least your voice upon my side. Let
          it be so; and, for heaven’s sake, let it be immediately. A wedding
          is the very thing to divert attention from these troubles in both
          kindreds.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our conversation
          was interrupted by Dromo, who told me that Silo the jailer had come
          to see me, and was below in the hall. There I found the humane man,
          with his little daughter in his hand, and walked aside with him
          into the inner portico of the house. I told him how the escape, for
          which his zeal alone was to be thanked, had been terminated—and to
          what <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name=
          "Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>resolution I had now
          come;—and then inquired whether no suspicion had been attached to
          himself, in consequence of his absence from the Capitoline. Having
          assured me that he had no reason to think so,—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The oath which I had taken to Trajan,”</span> said he,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“prevented me from adopting the simpler
          course of setting open for our dear friends the gates of the
          Mammertine; and I trust that I did not offend against that oath by
          acting as I did, after they had been taken away for the time from
          my keeping. But both they and you must be aware of the pain which I
          suffered during their confinement, and of the dangers which I have
          encountered by their escape. I am resolved no more to be subject to
          such struggles. I cannot preserve my faith as a Christian, and my
          honour as a servant of Trajan. This very day I resign my charge in
          the Mammertine; this very night, if it so please you, I am ready to
          accompany you and my dear young lady, in your flight to
          Britain.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I need not say
          with what gladness I heard this proposal. Returning to my friends,
          I informed them of what I had just heard, and perceiving now at
          last that there was no chance of diverting me from my project, they
          entered, like true friends, into serious consultation respecting
          the best method of carrying my project into execution. The aid of
          Silo, who had already given such proofs both of presence of mind,
          and of prudence, and courage, was regarded by them as of the
          highest importance. He was shortly summoned to take part in our
          deliberation, and it was resolved, that after resigning in a formal
          manner the office he held, and transferring his property for the
          present into the custody of Licinius, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>he should forthwith repair to Ostium, and
          there hire and put in readiness, for immediate use, a small vessel,
          the lightest he could find, in which the fugitive party might
          transport themselves at least as far as Corsica. To this the
          zealous Silo without hesitation assented. It was agreed that he
          should have the mariners on their benches by the coming on of
          night, and that he himself should be waiting for us by a certain
          ruined tower, which stands conspicuously by the river side, about a
          mile and a half above Ostium. We left it to Silo himself, to stock
          the bark with any merchandise which he might deem best adapted to
          deceive the superintendents of the haven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Partly from the
          necessity of making provision of various kinds for this voyage, but
          still more in consequence of the law-suit, with the termination of
          which you have just been made acquainted, I had no leisure that
          day, from which to work out unnecessary pain either for myself or
          for others. I had to assist Licinius in looking over an infinity of
          deeds, and to superintend the drawing out of others. In the next
          place, I had to go to the Forum for the purpose of manumitting some
          slaves, (such a largess being naturally expected); and while I was
          occupied with this, need I tell you, that my own poor Briton was
          not forgotten? Licinius having, at the joint request of Sextus and
          myself, accorded that morning to the Cretan also the well-merited
          gift of his liberty, Boto and Dromo were seen strutting about the
          Forum together for some moments, each arrayed in that worshipful
          cap which had formed the most prominent object in their day-dreams
          of felicity. I shall not trouble you with need<span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>less particulars. Let it suffice, that
          the greater part of the day was thus spent in unavoidable
          business.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards evening,
          I stole privately from my kinsman’s house, being willing to avoid a
          formal farewell, and repaired to Sabinus, who received me with very
          lively emotion. What he dwelt upon most fervently, however, was the
          probability—the certainty he seemed to esteem it—that a persecution
          of this nature could not be long persisted in by such a prince as
          Trajan; and the pleasure with which, that being all at an end, he
          should see me come back to Rome, and take due possession of the
          inheritance of my fathers. After expatiating most fluently for some
          minutes on the expected delights of that day, he paused suddenly,
          and then added, in a tone of some little hesitation, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And as for me, I wonder in what state you shall find
          me. Rich or poor—married or single—Centurion or Tribune—one thing
          is certain, that I shall, in all circumstances, be not a little
          rejoiced to see you.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“You had better marry, my good captain,”</span> said
          I.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Marry! me to marry? I have not the least thought of

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“And much, very much, Sabinus, in the conscious looks

          dreamt of. Fill your cup to the brim, boy, and since you are to
          leave us so speedily, I shall have no secrets for you. I have seen
          service;—true, but what of that? I have kept a <span class=

          day, it must be confessed, begins to wear a little, a very little,
          towards the evening; and, Castor! if you allow supper-time to slip
          over, I don’t know but you must go to bed with a light stomach. Now
          or never was the word, my boy; and the widow is mine
          own.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And Xerophrastes?”</span> said I.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And as for the most sagacious and venerable
          Xerophrastes, why, to tell you the truth, I see nothing for him but
          that he should allow his beard to curl as it pleases, drop his long
          cloak over his ambitious pair of shanks, forswear moonlight,
          purchase for himself a dark lantern instead, and see whether he
          can’t find, within the four walls of Rome, an honest Greek, and a
          constant widow, to make one blessed wedding withal. That is my
          advice to the Stoic—Stoic no longer—but, if there be hoops upon a
          tub, the most cynical of all Cynics.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When it was at
          last necessary that I should move—<span class="tei tei-q">“Dear
          Caius,”</span> said the Centurion, <span class="tei tei-q">“you
          know the Prefect has set a price on their heads, and I promise you
          it is such a temptation as no virtue, that keeps watch beneath any

          with. But hope, and dare. And here, take once more this helmet, and
          cloak, and sword, and with them share the password of the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sabinus then
          gave private orders to one of his troop, and walked with me towards
          the Esquiline.—But why should I linger over what little remains of

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>
